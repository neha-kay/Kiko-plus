In Harry Potter, Hermione ends up marrying Ron.

WHY.
WHY. 
WHY?

If you're like me, you were probably pretty skeptical of this arrangement. Put simply, Ron seems well below Hermione's league. 


But it's likely because we tend to want to be valued for our less obvious traits & abilites. I call this the 'Hermione Granger' effect. 

Unlike every other person, Ron valued her for who she _was_ versus solely recognizing her for her insane knowledge. I think in some sense, when something defines us, we want to be recognized for our other characteristics, given how often we're recognized for our more obvious abilities. 

Sugandha's [Quora comment](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Hermione-never-attracted-to-Harry-Why-fall-in-love-with-Ron-instead-of-Harry){:target="_blank"} explains the notion well:

> > "Love and attraction are largely about what one gets from a relationship. Is it self-confidence? Is it care? Is it fun? Different people have different preferences, but most people tend to be drawn to people who make them feel good about themselves. __Most smart people, in particular, tend to be drawn to people who can make them feel unique.__
> > 
> > What is "unique"? __For a common person, it means being treated like a star. For a star, it means being treated like a common person. Hermione was not a common person and she knew that. She was intelligent, smart, wise, and knowledgeable. Everybody else knew that too and she knew that they did. Being desired for these qualities would not have been be "the thing" for her.__
> > 
> > This behavior can be observed in the real world. __Most people want to be considered attractive for their less obvious traits and abilities.__ A woman who is undoubtedly gorgeous wants to be desired for her smartness and kindness. A woman who is undoubtedly intelligent wants to be desired for her beauty and niceness. A man who is successful in the eyes of the whole world wants his significant other to be able to look beyond his external opulence. A man who has failed in his career may be revered by everybody for his greatness as a human, but in some corner of his heart may be battling the need to be reassured that his partner does not think of him as a failure. 
> > 
> > It makes sense because __the only thing that differentiates a "special someone" from ordinary people is their ability to look past the outer shell and appreciate the hidden, protected side of one's identity. This is important because this side is also their most vulnerable side that they are not as confident about. And being liked for that is exhilarating and liberating for the sense of perfection and completeness it evokes.__
> > 
> > The human mind is full of ambiguous and never-ending whims and fancies. For someone as sharp as Hermione, being liked for her intellectual brilliance would be no different from what it is like for a supermodel to be liked for her hotnessâ€”common, expected, superficial, uninteresting, unexciting... nothing new. Ron's interest in her had an endearing ambiguity to it. He didn't seem to be drawn towards her for the qualities that defined Hermione for the rest of the world. While people loved and hated her for her extraordinary acumen and brimming curiosity, in Ron she found the conviction that she was also likable as just an ordinary girl."
