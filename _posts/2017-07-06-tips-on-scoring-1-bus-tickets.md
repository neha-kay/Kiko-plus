## The Basics
Companies like Boltbus and Megabus are notorious for selling coveted $1 tickets. I’ve gotten a few myself on otherwise pretty expensive routes, like San Francisco to Los Angeles. If you’re aiming for scoring one of these tickets consider the following tips: 

### I. Have a strategic travel window.

For the sake of scoring as cheap tickets as possible, a travel window with largely weekdays is best; generally Friday and Sunday travel tend to be more expensive, as well as holidays and weekend times. Check all dates in that travel window across all bus sites on [Wanderu](www.wanderu.com){:target="_blank"}.  

### II. Book 31-90 days in advance. 

Busbud analyzed the probability of finding a $ticket by analyzing 1 million+ departures and found the following:

> "The probability of finding a $1 bus ticket increases when you search a month in advance, hovering near the 4% mark when you search 31 days in advance, and reaches its peak with around the 90 day mark. The data becomes less reliable between 90 and 120 days as fewer people search that far in advance."

Unlike other carriers, Greyhound specifically offers $1 busses only 31 days in advance and not any earlier.

Megabus states $1 fares are given to _“the first or initial customers that purchase a ticket for that trip,”_ while every scheduled Boltbus trip offers at least one $1 fare every day. 

So it's pretty clear booking 31-90 days in advance is the most optimal period to buy a ticket. __If the tickets are in fact in the $1-$5 price range, it's well worth it to book multiple dates if you aren't sure when you're traveling, instead of booking a $20-$30 ticket at the last minute.__

### III. Aim to travel on a Tuesday or Wednesday (but still search all times in your travel window)
According to Busbud, you’re more likely to snag a $1 bus ticket set to travel on a Tuesday ir Wednesday than a Friday or weekend, simply because demand for weekend dates are higher.

### IV. Join the Dollar Bus Club
The Dollar Bus Club is a free email alert which emails you when a $1 bus fare was found in your city. Pretty neat!
