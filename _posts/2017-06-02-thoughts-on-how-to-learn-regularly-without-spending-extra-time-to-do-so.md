Below are some of the most useful methods I've come across, for learning without devoting too much time to doing so, in order from the least to most time intensive. 

The idea is to point out that anyone, a CEO or a waitress working three jobs, can employ at least the top few in her life. There are so many unexploited pockets of time in our day-to-day schedules that can easily be flipped into learning opportunities. 

So from the top: 

## 1. Listen to podcasts

### What are podcasts? 

Think of podcasts as TV shows but with audio only. 

Each podcast has different episodes, and there are podcasts of all different genres – education, comedy, arts, business, science, health, Spanish etc., So whether you’re interested in learning about history [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com){:target=":_blank"}, learning about Meditation [10% Happier](http://www.10percenthappier.com){:target=":_blank"}, listening to TED talks [Ted Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510298/ted-radio-hour){:target=":_blank"}, or listening to a science-comedy show [The Infinite Monkey Cage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w){:target=":_blank"}, there’s a podcast for you. 

### Time Required

Podcasts are the perfect time-creators, because they create learning time in transitory periods involving physical activity or commuting. They’re bit-sized (30 minutes – 1 hour long) and vary across topics so you can select which podcast you’re in the mood for. 

Podcasts are great for:

- Listening in the car/bus/commute
- While running errands 
- During household chores
- During physical activity (working out)

### Setup Time Required: Very Little

After the initial setup and subscribing of your favorite podcasts, occasional ‘podcast maintenance' – i.e. switching to iTunes, making sure the ones you want are downloaded to your device, etc., is very little. 

### How to Start

Time to Setup: ~ 30 min 

For iOS listeners, [this guide](http://www.everythingicafe.com/listen-to-podcasts-on-iphone/){{:target=":_blank"}} will get you going in about 30 minutes. Podcasts integrate seamlessly with the iTunes store and the Apple podcasts app, so listening to podcasts is a simple matter of downloading the podcast in the iTunes store and syncing your device, much like iTunes music. 

For Android listeners, there are a number of apps to choose from – some paid, some free. A popular free app is Stitcher, with a guide on getting started [here](http://jeremymccommons.com/business/learn-faster-8-simple-steps-for-stitcher-radio/){:target=":_blank"}. 

## 2. Read Saved Articles Via Pocket

Have you ever found an article which you’ve wanted to read but didn’t have the time to do so right then? 

….introducing Pocket! It allows you to save articles via a Google Chrome / Safari extension and download those articles to your phone/device for offline reading. That way, in those pockets of awkward time, in line to get food or on the subway, or at the doctor’s office, you can easily read the articles you’ve saved to Pocket, which will appear, automatically downloaded for you. 

Usually, when I’m doing work on my desktop and come across articles, I’ll save them to Pocket and overtime, the articles accumulate, such that the app becomes a personally curated magazine. Better yet, the app analyzes your selections and, based on similar users, suggests articles for you. 

### Time Required 

Literally all you need to do is download the app and save a few articles for later. 

<h2> 3. Maintaining a <i>Things I Learned</i> List </h2>

By reflecting at the end of the day, what you've learned earlier, you'll force yourself to remember and notice 'learned lessons' of the day - both when writing it down and during the day. 

### Time Required

10 minutes a day and the ability to keep doing it and make it a long-standing habit -- *that's* the hardest part. A good way of making it a long-standing habit is to pair it with another routine -- for example, pairing it with your bedtime routine.

## 3. Listen to Audiobooks

### What are audiobooks? 

Audiobooks are quite simply, books read aloud - better suited for longer commutes and uninterrupted listening sessions. Always wanted to read Steve Jobs’ biography? Or Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers? You can, without the downtime of sitting down and physically reading the book. 

This works best with books that are engaging – I’ve listened to a number that weren’t and the overall effect led to some serious mind wandering. So if the book you’re listening to happens to be particularly dull, skip it and move on. 

Audiobooks work best for lighter books – books that don’t require heavy pondering or note-taking. Sometimes it’s hard to figure that out in advance but when I get it wrong (i.e. read a book chock full of areas I should be taking notes in), I usually grab a copy and read it the old-fashioned way. 

### Time Required

The time to listen to audiobooks usually involves the time to find it, buy it, and download it to your device. If you intend to buy your audiobooks or use Audible or Audiobooks.com, it can get a bit pricey, unlike podcasts which are free. However, you get the benefit of listening to well crafted, and well developed books – from Harry Potter if you choose, to virtually any modern book in existence.

How to Start

My recommendation would be to:
A. Think of the books you’ve most wanted to read. If you don’t have one in mind, you can search a subject you’re interested in on Amazon (“raising kids”) and find books that are highly rated and start there.
B. Find the audiobook version (either posted free online at a catalog like the one here or in Amazon)
C. Download to your device	

iOS – You can use the native iBooks app – more information [here](http://www.macworld.com/article/2975943/software-books/how-to-listen-to-audiobooks-on-ios.html){:target=":_blank"}.

## 4. Learning from Others 

I include this here because I think, at a loss of all the tech-y stuff above, you can still prioritize learning in daily life via other people. For me, this is normally in the form of starting a conversation with someone and aiming to walk away having learned at least 1 thing from that conversation. 

It could be anything – learning a fact from that person or analyzing that person, conversation, or situation, to learn something about human nature, yourself, your preferences in others, etc.,

With earnest questioning and by asking about things I’m genuinely interested in (which also helps to avoid the usual superficial small talk), I’m usually able to walk away having learned at least one thing (and if I’m extra lucky, a connection, be it personal or work-oriented). And if it doesn’t work out (say it ends up being fairly superficial or I lose my courage and become shy), I try again with another person in another coffee line or at the subway. 

### Time Required 
 
I think here, the more relevant unit is, ‘courage required’. 

For me, it takes a lot of courage to get out of my comfort zone (and off my phone) to start up a conversation with someone next to me. Sometimes even that isn’t enough. For that reason, sometimes I incorporate it into my personal habits list, or in other words, aim to have a conversation with X number of new people per week, and checkmark and tally the number of times I do so. Either way, it pays off.

## 5. eBooks 

And last but not least, eBooks! Otherwise known as books on the go, or at home, or really anywhere, because they’re eBooks! Once these are downloaded to my phone and once it’s a book that I truly enjoy, reading it on the go becomes a preference and not an obligation.   

### Time Required

In this case you need to dedicate time to actually reading – but this can be on the go if you don’t have time otherwise. 

## How to Start

As with audiobooks, you should: 

A.	Think of the books you’ve most wanted to read. If you don’t have one in mind, you can search a subject you’re interested in on Amazon (“how to build charisma”) and find books that are highly rated and start there.

B.	Find the eBook version (either posted free online or in Amazon via the Kindle app) and download to your device.
