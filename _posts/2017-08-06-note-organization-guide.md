In May of 2017 I realized I had ~800 discrete notes without an overall structure or basis for organization. 

_Gasp!_

Afterall, what's the point of taking the time to write out notes if there's no organized way of retrieving or re-viewing them? If my current note-taking habits continue at this rate, quite soon I'll have 1,000+ notes, all of which would serve their purpose far better with a system that allowed for easy searching and access.

That got me thinking about various platforms I could formalize a structure with. Throughout June, I cultivated the system described below. 

This is by no means the *best* way to organize one's notes but it's the way that works quite well for me. 

### What defines a good note organization system?

##### 1. Scalability
The ability to seamlessly handle upwards of 5,000 notes without losing the essential features listed below. This is the point at which cataloging becomes as important a feature as the note-taking itself. It's also where most note-taking apps fall short --- because they maximize the note-taking experience without building the infrastructure for hardcore note cataloging. 

##### 2. Great search function & ease of note retrieval.
With upwards of 5,000 notes, a good note organization system should quickly find the information one needs. 

##### 3. Ability to convert to other platforms.
I hate being exclusively reliant on one platform. What happens if they [get bought and no longer remain supported](https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/microsoft-sunrise/){:target="_blank"}? Or if they have a [major change in policy](https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/28/evernote-price-increase-basic-two-device-limit/){:target="_blank"}?

A perfect example is Evernote's recent policy change preventing free users from [using Evernote on more than two devices](https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/28/evernote-price-increase-basic-two-device-limit/){:target="_blank"}. This, along with other recent decisions marked Evernote's trend of pushing users to purchase a Premium or Plus plan --- which I was not on board for. 

This is also precisely the reason why it's so important to always be able to __easily and efficiently export your data to another platform if needed.__  

Before fully committing to any application, I always look into the ability to convert the format of the given application to other forms -- in the case of note-taking, to be able to convert individual notes to text, Word, or Evernote format.

##### 4. General app popularity.
Popular apps come with a number of features which include: 

* A strong team of developers who continue to produce updates, bug fixes, and new features.
* A far lower risk of the app being discontinued.
* A number of add-ons, plugins, or compatible apps/features, as developers make handy side-applications to support the main application. 
* A number of help forums that come with insight on more advanced features. 

##### 5. The ability to have multiple levels of organization.
This refers to the ability to categorize notes in notebooks, tags, sections, etc., At a scale of 100 notes, multiple levels of organization are overkill. At a scale of 1,000+ notes, multiple levels of organization are _essential_. 

##### 6. Support across multiple devices, cloud synchronization, and offline use.
Particularly ease of access and syncing capabilities across devices and the ability to use the apps offline and have changed synced back up later. 

##### 7. Seamless syncing and support across all forms of notetaking.
This includes quick-and-dirty notetaking, on-the-go notetaking, mobile note-taking, long-form note-taking.

##### 8. A decent user interface. 
Clean and intuitive. 

##### 9. Other Cool Features 
For example, version control/page history, the ability to handle formats like images, PDFs, voice recordings, etc., 

### An Overview of My Solution. 
My system involves 3 core elements: 

#### I. Microsoft OneNote 
As my central hub for notes.
(iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web)

#### II. Google Keep & iOS Stickies 
For quick & dirty note-taking.
(iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web)

#### III. Day One 
As my personal diary.
(iOS, Mac)

### I. Microsoft OneNote | The Central Hub

This is where the *real beauty* of the system kicks in. Why OneNote, you may ask?

#### I. OneNote has __most all__ the features described above. 

The most important features which distinguish it from other note-taking apps are the following: 

##### Scalability
ONENOTE SCALABILITY IS SO FREAKING GOOD OMG. 

It easily handles scalability with __4 levels of organization__ --- notebooks, sections, pages, and optional subpages. This means even a scale of 2,000 notes can be searched incredibly effectively and easily, assuming a constant distribution of notes across organization sub-levels. Search functions at this scale are still great. Unlike 95% of existing note-taking apps, it has the ability to both catalog *and* note-take. 

##### Great Export Options
Say you want to ditch OneNote. It has export options which allow you to export individual pages, sections, or notebooks to pretty much any format you'd want --- [Word, PDF, XPS,](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/22679/beginner-save-your-onenote-2010-docs-to-different-file-formats/){:target="_blank"} [text](http://www.onenotegem.com/document/export-onenote-pages-to-txt-files){:target="_blank"}, etc.,

##### Decent User Interface / Cloud Synchronization / Offline Use
Their user interface is good --- easy to figure out and with pretty extensive coverage across different interfaces. Their syncing system & offline use could be better, but I mostly rely on Google Keep for those functions so they make little difference to my note-taking system. 

##### II. Other amazing features 
* Intensive formatting (versus a simpler formatting experience on Evernote)
* Support of more free-form note-taking (versus solely a linear top-to-bottom one)
* Page Version History (showing a history of edits made to a given page)
* Page templates 
* In built drawing, recording audio and video functions
* In built scanning & embedded spreadsheet functions
* Email notes to OneNote
* Full integration & easy export to Microsoft Word 

#### Why OneNote over Evernote? 

A couple of elements led me to choose Microsoft OneNote over competitors like Evernote:

##### I. OneNote's free software far exceeds the capability of Evernote's free plan.
Most all of the features described above come free on OneNote whereas the Evernote free plan is far less robust. I'd also argue the paid Evernote plans are simply not as robust as that of OneNote. For example WHY do I need [a paid Evernote subscription for offline access](https://www.cloudwards.net/evernote-vs-onenote/){:target="_blank"}??

##### II. Signs of trouble with the company itself.
[As Lifehacker puts it](https://lifehacker.com/note-taking-showdown-evernote-vs-onenote-2016-editio-1765707423){:target="_blank"}:

> "There have been troubling signs with the company too. Evernote co-founder Phil Libin stepped down as CEO last July, the company laid off 13% of its staff two months later, and they also closed three of its global offices. Perhaps Evernote is just transitioning to a leaner, more focused company, but with them shutting down Evernote Food and ending support for Skitch and Clearly, it’s reasonable to be concerned about the future of one of our favorite note-taking apps."

I also fundamentally dislike some of their more recent moves, like [limiting users to 2 devices](https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/28/evernote-price-increase-basic-two-device-limit/){:target="_blank"} and [restricting offline access](http://classroom.synonym.com/can-work-evernote-offline-mode-8818.html){:target="_blank"} on the free plan.

That being said, Evernote is a __good__ platform, particularly if you're heavily invested in it and use many of its advanced features. It has a solid organization system and if you have 1,000+ notes, it's likely better to simply continue using Evernote and work on cleaning the organization system itself rather than starting from scratch on OneNote. 

I ended up switching from Evernote to OneNote, despite having an 800 note system already on Evernote and suffice to say, it was definitely worth the switch. It took about 20-30 hours to copy over all of my notes which is a high startup cost, but is a low cost thereafter. 

### How my Microsoft OneNote Central Hub is Set Up

Given that this is the central hub of notes, __all permanent notes will eventually be migrated and sorted into OneNote.

Each major life topic corresponds to a separate notebook: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/note-organization-guide/note-org-guide-one-note-notebooks.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/note-organization-guide/note-org-guide-one-note-notebook.png">
</p>

Each notebook has a corresponding set of **sections**, **pages**, and optional **subpages**, allowing you to really drill-down and organize each element of a topic. 

As an example, this is my personal Advice notebook, drilled down into topics (sections) and insights on those topics (pages). If a topic has multiple advice tidbits, they’re displayed on different pages. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/note-organization-guide/note-org-one-note-setup.png">
</p>

This allows for incredibly easy navigating and search. If I’m looking for a specific chai recipe, for example, I’ll navigate to Food --> Cooking ---> Dipti’s Chai Recipe. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/note-organization-guide/note-org-cooking.png">
</p>

Alternatively, if I’m looking for information about my trip to China, I’ll navigate to the Travel notebook, then the China Section, and check out the individual pages. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/note-organization-guide/note-org-one-note-travel.png">
</p>

Amazing! You can get more intense with tags and such, but at my current note-taking level, this is perfect.


### Quick and dirty note-taking | Google Keep & Stickies

Every proper note-taking system should have a mechanism for raw note-taking. That’s the purpose of Google Keep and iOS Stickies in this system. They take care of the day-to-day note-taking needs of:
* Jotting down advice / notes through out the day
* Temporary notes like shopping lists, reminders, and to-dos

Google Keep is *amazing* in this regard – the mobile app and the Web platform sync smoothly allowing for easy transferring of notes taken on a cell phone to one’s computer and vice versa. The syncing is so good that I’ll often use Google Keep solely for transferring data like addresses, WiFi passwords, etc., from my computer to my phone. Plus, it has great offline, collaboration, and archive options. 

iOS Stickies are great for quick and dirty jotting down of ideas while offline or when unable to connect to the web on your Mac.  

### Personal Journal | Day One

Day One by and far is *the* singular best journal app – I challenge you to find one that’s better. It has an incredible ability to sync beautifully across mobile and desktop platforms, incorporate photos, locations, tags, and sorting into entries, along with different journal views, including a calendar view. It’s simply amazing. 

I use this for strictly personal entries – entries about my current emotions, wins and setbacks. The calendar function allows me to scroll through various months and read entries while the ‘On this Day’ function allows me to see past entries I’ve written on the same day in previous years.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/note-org-guide-day-one.png">
</p>

### How the elements interact

When I have a bit of downtime I’ll usually transfer more permanent Google Keep and Stickies notes into my OneNote (and delete the temporary ones). OneNote holds all my notes, while Day One hold all my personal diary entries. 
 
## Conclusion

And that’s ultimately it! The system, particularly with a centralized OneNote hub, works beautifully. Given how scalable it is, I don’t think it’s changing anytime soon  That’s it – if you have your own (better?) note organization system, mention it below in the comments! Till then, I hope this was of help.
