## Background

In May of 2017 I realized I had ~800 discrete notes in my Evernote notebooks without an overall structure or basis for organization. That got me thinking about various platforms I could formalize a structure with – especially since, here on out, my notes would only continue to accumulate. 

So throughout June I cultivated the system described below. This is by no means the *best* way to organize one's notes but it's the way that works quite well for me. 

Everything below is in my humble opinion and I hope from it, you can find a couple useful tidbits .

## What defines a good note organization system?

1. Scalability
The ability to seamlessly handle upwards of 5,000 notes, without losing other essential features below

2. Great search function & ease of note retrieval 
With upwards of 5,000 notes, a good note organization system should quickly find the information one needs. 

3. Ability to convert to other platforms
I hate being exclusively reliant on one platform. What happens if they suddenly close down or change policy? One thing which moved me away from Evernote was its change in policy which prevented free users from using Evernote on more than two devices. Not cool. 

Before fully committing to any application, I always look into the ability to convert the format of the application to other forms -- in the case of note-taking, to be able to convert individual notes to text, Word, or Evernote formats.

4. General app popularity
The more popular an application is, the more likely its developers will continue to produce updates, bug fixes, and improvements. An app that isn't quite as popular runs the risk of being discontinued, so I generally prefer more popular apps over smaller ones. 

5. The ability to have multiple levels of organization
This refers to the ability to categorize notes in notebooks, tags, sections, etc., At a scale of 100 notes, multiple levels of organization are overkill. At a scale of 1,000+ notes, multiple levels of organization are essential. 

6. Support & syncing across multiple devices and offline
Particularly ease of access and syncing capabilities across devices and the ability to use the apps offline and have changed synced back up later. 

7. Support all forms of notetaking
This includes quick-and-dirty notetaking, on-the-go notetaking, mobile note-taking, long-form note-taking, and the ability to handle formats like images, PDFs, and voice recordings. 

## General Setup 
My system involves 3 elements: 

Central Hub
* Microsoft One Note -- my central hub for notes (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows)

Personal Diary
* Day One (iOS, Mac)

Quick and Dirty Notes
* Google Keep (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web)
* iOS Stickies (iOS, Mac)

### Quick and dirty note-taking | Google Keep & Stickies

Every proper note-taking system should have a mechanism for raw note-taking. That’s the purpose of Google Keep and iOS Stickies in this system. They take care of the day-to-day note-taking needs of:
* Jotting down advice / notes through out the day
* Temporary notes like shopping lists, reminders, and to-dos

Google Keep is *amazing* in this regard – the mobile app and the Web platform sync smoothly allowing for easy transferring of notes taken on a cell phone to one’s computer and vice versa. The syncing is so good that I’ll often use Google Keep solely for transferring data like addresses, WiFi passwords, etc., from my computer to my phone. Plus, it has great offline, collaboration, and archive options. 

iOS Stickies are great for quick and dirty jotting down of ideas while offline or when unable to connect to the web on your Mac.  

### The central hub | Microsoft OneNote

This is where the *real beauty* of the system kicks in. A couple of elements led me to choose Microsoft OneNote over competitors like Evernote:

Why OneNote?
OneNote satisfies all of the requirements specified above – it easily handles scale of notes, and has 4 levels of organization (notebooks, sections, pages, and optional subpages) which means a scale of 1,000+ notes can be organized very efficiently. Its search function is great and because of its immense popularity, a number of scripts and applications can convert OneNote notes to various formats. OneNote can handle pretty much any file type, including images, PDFs and even hand-written notes within the app, while having superb multi-device and offline functioning. 

Between OneNote and Evernote, I felt OneNote’s level of organization was more extensive than that of Evernote (for example, on OneNote, you can organize by notebook, section, and pages) while Evernote had (what I perceived to be) a more complicated system of organization. Finally, the fact that they recently decided to downgrade free users to only 2 devices solidified my jump over to OneNote. 

### How my OneNote is set up 

Each major life topic corresponds to a separate notebook:

</p>

Within each notebook are corresponding sections (highlighted by the green box) and pages (highlighted by the blue box). As an example, this is the Advice notebook, with advice blurbs on various topics (sections). If a topic has multiple advice tidbits, they’re displayed on different pages.

</p>

This allows for incredibly easy navigating and search. If I’m looking for a specific chai recipe, I’ll navigate to Food  Cooking  Dipti’s Chai Recipe. Alternatively, if I’m looking for information about my trip to China, I’ll navigate to the Travel notebook, then the China Section, and check out the individual pages.

Amazing! You can get more intense with tags and such, but at my current note-taking level, this is perfect.

### Personal Journal | Day One

Day One by and far is *the* singular best journal app – I challenge you to find one that’s better. It has an incredible ability to sync beautifully across mobile and desktop platforms, incorporate photos, locations, tags, and sorting into entries, along with different journal views, including a calendar view. It’s simply amazing. 

I use this for strictly personal entries – entries about my current emotions, wins and setbacks. The calendar function allows me to scroll through various months and read entries while the ‘On this Day’ function allows me to see past entries I’ve written on the same day in previous years.

### How the elements interact

When I have a bit of downtime I’ll usually transfer more permanent Google Keep and Stickies notes into my OneNote (and delete the temporary ones). OneNote holds all my notes, while Day One hold all my personal diary entries. 
 
## Conclusion

And that’s ultimately it! The system, particularly with a centralized OneNote hub, works beautifully. Given how scalable it is, I don’t think it’s changing anytime soon  That’s it – if you have your own (better?) note organization system, mention it below in the comments! Till then, I hope this was of help.
