1.	Introduction
2.	Representing time
a.	Different electronic representations
3.	Incorporating this system into everyday life
a.	All formal events should be added to Google Calendar 
i.	This includes:
1.	Classes, hangouts, videochats, office hours, work meetings, etc.,
2.	Anything which involves a commitment to another person should go into your Google Calendar as soon as you make the decision to meet up.
4.	Setting up the System
a.	Setting up this system has a high startup cost and low maintenance cost. Personally, I find the ease of mind of not having to remember things _so, so, so_ worth it.
b.	This system has 3 views:
i.	A macro level view (Excel template)
ii.	A weekly to-do list
iii.	A day-to-day scheduling view (Google Calendar)
c.	Set up an Excel template of the semester / next 3 months / or whatever period of time is most relevant
i.	Enter major events like tests, major project due dates, major problem sets, extracurricular events, etc., in this Excel calendar.
ii.	This Excel template functions to show you on how time is progressing on a large scale. You can use the sidebar and area below to portion out big goals into 2-week or 1-week periods.
iii.	 
d.	Set up Google Calendar for day-to-day scheduling
i.	If you’re already set up on Apple calendar or a written calendar journal and your setup is extensive, stick with that calendar platform. If you have a minimal setup or no setup, __use Google Calendar__.
ii.	Why Google Calendar over Apple Calendar or X Calendar service? 
1.	Google Calendar generally transfers better across devices and apps (for example switching from an iPhone to an Android phone is seamless via Google Calendar), is universally supported by every calendar add-on, plugin, or application, and has a number of import, export, sharing, and customizing options that Apple calendar just doesn’t have. 
iii.	Set up individual calendars
1.	I used to maintain as many as 10 calendars for different elements of my life (e.g. exercise, school, friends, meetings, classes, etc.,) but I’ve found the transaction costs of A) deciding which calendar it should be in and B) clicking and setting up the event in that calendar to way undermined the worth of having that many calendars. I now maintain 3-4 active calendars which I find to be way, way less tedious: 
a.	Explain calendars
iv.	Download a mobile calendar app for mobile access
1.	Every major calendar app is compatible with Google Calendar 
e.	Build the habit of always entering an event into Google Calendar
i.	This gets rid of the decision-making process of whether to put something into Google Calendar – instead, don’t waste time deciding – just take 30 seconds to enter it in and forget about it.
