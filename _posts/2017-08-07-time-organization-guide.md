## Introduction

Before starting I want to first point out that I am just another human – by no means the most organized person. These are simply my ideas on time organization and what has worked for me. I hope you glean some useful tidbits from it. If you have useful (or better?) tips, leave them in the comments below. 

One last thing: this post features a number of excel templates. If you’d like to get the original Excel template, email me at [neha@nehakay.com](mailto:neha@nehakay.com). 

With that, onwards, new friend! 

## How my time organization system is set up 

### Different views of time

In the same way that Google Calendar has a day, week, and month view, I have 3 different ‘views’ of time:

1.	A multi-month view

For example, when I’m in school, this is usually a view of the entire semester with important dates like midterms or significant extra-curriculars marked:

*Multi-month view*
</p>

2.	A month view

*Month view while traveling during vacation*
</p>

3.	A week view 
Sup on Google Calendar, highlighting day-to-day activities (more on this later):

  <img src="/images/time-org-work-in-cal.png">
</p>

Together, these views help me make the most informed decisions on what I can get done within a given time period. In this guide, I’ll go through the benefits of each view and how to set them up to become more organized with respect to time.

Setting up this system has a high startup cost and low maintenance cost. Personally, I find the ease of mind of not having to remember things _so, so, so_ worth it.

### Multi-month & month views 
Multi-month and month views are important because time passes quickly on a day-to-day level and often makes us lose sight of how time progresses from a more bird’s eye view. In that sense, seeing time progress on a month level is __incredibly__ helpful. 

Enter major events like tests, major project due dates, major problem sets, extracurricular events, etc., in this Excel calendar.

### Setting up multi-month and month views
I highly recommend setting up multi-month and month views in **Excel** because I strongly prefer having all my planning tools exclusively on Excel and Google Calendar rather than on multiple platforms for different planning purposes – e.g. having Omnifocus for goal planning, Google Calendar for weekly scheduling, a PDF for month planning, etc., Excel is versatile enough to handle it all. Plus, it’s incredibly versatile, looks nice, and you can dedicate separate sheets to separate purposes, including a _To-Do_ sheet as a separate sheet. That means you have your calendars and to-do lists all in two places – Excel and Google Calendar. 

That being said, the setup is 1 simple step: email me at [neha@nehakay.com](mailto:neha@nehakay.com) for the email template and I’ll send it your way – from there just customize it by copying and pasting in boxes and filling in the right month dates. The template has both the multi-month view, semester view, and the month view displayed above.

### Weekly & daily views 

For weekly and daily views, ALL HAIL GOOGLE CALENDAR! 

#### Setting up the system

#### Step 1: Log into your Gmail account and head to www.calendar.google.com.

If you’re already set up on Apple calendar or a written calendar journal and your setup is extensive, stick with that calendar platform. If you have a minimal setup or no setup, __use Google Calendar__.

__Why Google Calendar over Apple Calendar or X Calendar service?__

Google Calendar generally transfers better across devices and apps (for example switching from an iPhone to an Android phone is seamless via Google Calendar), is universally supported by every calendar add-on, plugin, or application, and has a number of import, export, sharing, and customizing options that Apple calendar just doesn’t have. 

#### Step 2: Set up individual calendars (if you need guidance on how to do this refer to [this](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095?hl=en){:target="_blank"})

I used to maintain as many as 10 calendars for different elements of my life (e.g. exercise, school, friends, meetings, classes, etc.,) but I’ve found the transaction costs of A) deciding which calendar it should be in and B) clicking and setting up the event in that calendar to way undermined the worth of having that many calendars. I now maintain 3-4 active calendars which I find to be way, way less tedious: 

#### Step 3: Download a mobile calendar app for mobile access -- every major calendar app is compatible with Google Calendar. I use the [native Google Calendar app](https://www.google.com/calendar/about/){:target="_blank"}. Set up your mobile app to default to the day view; this way you can refer to your phone’s calendar for your day-to-day schedule (and presumably your laptop for the week view).

#### Maintaining the system
* All formal events should be added to Google Calendar. This includes classes, hangouts, videochats, office hours, work meetings, etc., In other words, anything which involves a commitment to another person should go into your Google Calendar as soon as you make the decision to meet up

__Build the habit of always entering an event into Google Calendar__

This gets rid of the decision-making process of whether to put something into Google Calendar – instead, don’t waste time deciding – just take 30 seconds to enter it in and forget about it.
