### Welcome! 
Welcome to the Time Organization Guide! 

This guide is specifically for:

* Getting rid of that overwhelmed/powerless feeling --- the feeling that you don’t have control over your time 
* Have a better grasp of the time you have to get work done
* Not having to remember what you’re doing by when and outsourcing that information so you can focus on the things you actually need to do

This guide is Part 2 of the 3-part Productivity Guide. If your current time management system is already up to snuff, I’d recommend checking out the other two pieces: 


 
### The Basics
Time organization is one of those things that’s _highly_ idiosyncratic; some people have phenomenal systems using paper calendars while others love bullet journaling, while still are fine without even having a time organization system at all. So do what works for you, and it may not be the system I describe here. That being said, if you’re like me, and like having things 1000% organized and laid out so you can focus on what matters, what you’ll read below is likely to be incredibly useful. 

In this guide, I’ll layout:
* Multiple time layouts I find the most useful
* How to set up a central time hub around Google Calendar
* How to maintain your central time hub

### Different views of time
Conventionally, most people maintain solely a weekly and daily view on time. And while you can map things out like this, I find it _incredibly_ useful to have both macro level (multi-month/month) views and micro level (weekly/daily) views. This is for a couple reasons: 

##### I. Time simply looks different from a monthly perspective

It’s far easier to get a sense of how each week translates to progress on major milestones (test, big deadlines, etc.,) than on a sole week view.

##### II. It helps you translate larger goals to smaller ones

Consider the goal of studying for a test --- it’s way easier to outline achieving this seeing a monthly calendar than solely the week leading up to the test. 

##### III. It’s a wake-up call of how fast time moves

As they say, “the days are long but the years are short”. The same goes for months and semesters; before you know it, it’s the end of the month or that massive deadline is approaching. In this sense, having a monthly view will keep you _aware_ of how time passes on a macro level, rather than having it hit you in that final week. 


### Macro Level Views

1.	A multi-month view

For example, when I’m in school, this is usually a view of the entire semester with important dates like midterms or significant extra-curriculars marked:

*Multi-month view*
</p>

2.	A month view

*Month view while traveling during vacation*
</p>

3.	A week view 
Sup on Google Calendar, highlighting day-to-day activities (more on this later):

</p>

Together, these views help me make the most informed decisions on what I can get done within a given time period. In this guide, I’ll go through the benefits of each view and how to set them up to become more organized with respect to time.

Setting up this system has a high startup cost and low maintenance cost. Personally, I find the ease of mind of not having to remember things _so, so, so_ worth it.

### Multi-month & month views 
Multi-month and month views are important because time passes quickly on a day-to-day level and often makes us lose sight of how time progresses from a more bird’s eye view. In that sense, seeing time progress on a month level is __incredibly__ helpful. 

Enter major events like tests, major milestones, due dates, major problem sets, extracurricular events, etc., in this Excel calendar.

### Setting up multi-month and month views
I highly recommend setting up multi-month and month views in **Excel** because I strongly prefer having all my planning tools exclusively on Excel and Google Calendar rather than on multiple platforms for different planning purposes – e.g. having Omnifocus for goal planning, Google Calendar for weekly scheduling, a PDF for month planning, etc., Excel is versatile enough to handle it all. Plus, it’s incredibly versatile, looks nice, and you can dedicate separate sheets to separate purposes, including a _To-Do_ sheet as a separate sheet. That means you have your calendars and to-do lists all in two places – Excel and Google Calendar. 

That being said, the setup is 1 simple step: email me at [neha@nehakay.com](mailto:neha@nehakay.com) for the email template and I’ll send it your way – from there just customize it by copying and pasting in boxes and filling in the right month dates. The template has both the multi-month view, semester view, and the month view displayed above.

### Weekly & daily views 

For weekly and daily views, ALL HAIL GOOGLE CALENDAR! 

#### Setting up the system

#### Step 1: Log into your Gmail account and head to www.calendar.google.com.

If you’re already set up on Apple calendar or a written calendar journal and your setup is extensive, stick with that calendar platform. If you have a minimal setup or no setup, __use Google Calendar__.

__Why Google Calendar over Apple Calendar or X Calendar service?__

Google Calendar generally transfers better across devices and apps (for example switching from an iPhone to an Android phone is seamless via Google Calendar), is universally supported by every calendar add-on, plugin, or application, and has a number of import, export, sharing, and customizing options that Apple calendar just doesn’t have. 

#### Step 2: Set up individual calendars (if you need guidance on how to do this refer to [this](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095?hl=en){:target="_blank"})

I used to maintain as many as 10 calendars for different elements of my life (e.g. exercise, school, friends, meetings, classes, etc.,) but I’ve found the transaction costs of A) deciding which calendar it should be in and B) clicking and setting up the event in that calendar to way undermined the worth of having that many calendars. I now maintain 3-4 active calendars which I find to be way, way less tedious: 

#### Step 3: Download a mobile calendar app for mobile access -- every major calendar app is compatible with Google Calendar. I use the [native Google Calendar app](https://www.google.com/calendar/about/){:target="_blank"}. Set up your mobile app to default to the day view; this way you can refer to your phone’s calendar for your day-to-day schedule (and presumably your laptop for the week view).

#### Maintaining the system
* All formal events should be added to Google Calendar. This includes classes, hangouts, videochats, office hours, work meetings, etc., In other words, anything which involves a commitment to another person should go into your Google Calendar as soon as you make the decision to meet up

__Build the habit of always entering an event into Google Calendar__

This gets rid of the decision-making process of whether to put something into Google Calendar – instead, don’t waste time deciding – just take 30 seconds to enter it in and forget about it.
