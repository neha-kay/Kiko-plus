## Introduction

This guide is going to be less extensive than the Time Organization or Productivity Guide – mostly because the sole purpose of this guide is to highlight different ways of representing and laying out goals and action items. I have a rather different system based out of Excel and pen & paper but it works and it works well, so I figured I’d share it. 

Before starting I want to first point out that I am just another human – by no means the most organized person. These are simply my ideas on goal organization and what has worked for me. I hope you glean some useful tidbits from it. If you have useful (or better?) tips, leave them in the comments below. 

Disclaimer: You don’t have to use all the methods described in this guide – at various points I’ll use some or all – the idea is simply to achieve clarity in what needs to be done at various scales in time – a semester, 3 months, a week, and that day. Sometimes I prefer using more drawn out tools like the one above, especially when I have a lot of time on hand while other times I’ll just use a quick jotted down to-do list. Do what works for you. At the bottom of the page I have links to other great organization and productivity sources if you’re interested in reading more. 

One last thing: this post features a number of excel templates. If you’d like to get the original Excel template, email me at [neha@nehakay.com](mailto:neha@nehakay.com). 

With that, onwards, new friend! 

## Macro Level Goal Planning

I love macro level goal planning. It just feels super optimistic / inspiring / awesome. I also think it’s the best place to start at the beginning of any ‘new phase’ – a new semester, before starting a job, before a vacation, etc., 

My favorite method of macro level planning is imagining myself in the future and thinking retrospectively about what I’d feel great having gotten done or achieved. I ask myself something along these lines:  

__“Imagine you just got off the plane in Dallas after 8 Months. You have a wide grin on your face because you've accomplished *everything* you set out to accomplish. What did you accomplish?__
 
Yes, it’s a cheesy process but it works so well! I’ll then go ahead and outline various goals underneath which might look like this: 

•	Newsletter in motion
o	Effortless way of keeping in touch with people
o	Engaging content, links to blog
•	Website
o	Works and doesn't shut down all the time
o	Has a significant number of viewers/readers (>50-100/day)
o	Incorporated into daily life -- I naturally seek to write

At this point, you’ll likely have a number of goals – maybe as many as 7 or 10 depending on how optimistic you are. Sometimes I find it helpful to identify which of these goals are priorities by asking myself:

__”Say you could only accomplish 5 of these. Which would it be and why?”__ 

And using the following template as a reflective tool:

| Mission | Why is this important to you? | Generic Ways to Accomplish Mission | Actionable Next Steps |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| | 😕😕😕 | 🙂🙂🙂 | |

Pro-tip: When creating missions, I think it’s vitally important that you make sure your missions are entirely within your control. So instead of “Give a TED talk”, something determined largely by the external forces of the selection committee, you could write, “Write a TED worthy compelling narrative / story”.

Another way of viewing macro level projects is something like the following:

## Project Pipeline

Given that our macro-level planning has yielded a core set of projects to work on, we’re ready for the Project Pipeline.

The project pipeline is simply a more finely grained view of the very projects we listed above, with more emphasis on __actionable tasks__ - in other words, tasks which are written in such a way that you could physically do them. There’s no ambiguity about how to do them. Below are a couple examples of non-actionable tasks turned into a set of actionable tasks. 

| Bad “Actionable Task” Example | Good “Actionable Task” Example |
| :------: | :------: |
| Study for Italian test | Do 3 sets of Duolingo flash cards, read chapters 4 & 5 of textbook😕😕😕 |
| Exercise | Do the 25 minute Jillian “Killer Buns” workout everyday for the next 6 days |

After either a brain dump session or a macro planning session we begin laying out goals/action items per project with the following template: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/goal-org-guide-project-view.png">
</p>

I like this setup for a few reasons: 

* It’s great if you have multiple projects you’re managing. Organized by project / class allows us to pick and choose which projects are more pressing or which we’re more in the mood for.
* Breaking tasks down by the time it takes to do them is helpful when deciding what to do on a day-to-day basis. If I have small blocks of time, I know I can grab tasks from the *Quick* column and quickly finish them off during those small time blocks. 
* If you have a lot of action items in the 5-8 hour column, it’s likely because they aren’t broken down into actionable sub-tasks. For example, ‘study for Data Structures test’ can be broken down into “Read Chapter 5, read chapter 6, etc.,” each of which go in either of the first three columns.
* You can highlight in Yellow the more pressing tasks.

This view gives you a sense of 2-3 week action items, allowing you to perfectly filter out which of the tasks you want to take care of this week. 

## Weekly Planning

From the Project Pipeline view above, I’ll usually pick out all the action items I need to get done this week as a sort of free-form list of tasks. By that I mean, I’ll literally cut and paste the task from the project view into a separate ‘weekly to-do’ area. From there, making sure each task is A) incredibly actionable (e.g. no ambiguity of what needs to be done in order to cross it off the list) and B) is able to be completed within a 0-4 hour block. If it isn’t able to be completed in that time block, I’ll try and break the task down a bit further. 
	
I don’t have a set platform for weekly planning – sometimes I’ll use pen and paper, other times I’ll use my Mac Stickies app, other times I’ll plan each task out per day on my Google Calendar. 

## Other Cool Views & Planning Tools
### Brain dumps
I like to have a _Done_ category on my Excel page, solely for the indulgence of looking back and seeing how far I’ve come. 

### Brain dumps
Brain dumps involve racking your brain for every existing project and action item, and getting it all on paper. They’re particularly great to do during a macro level planning session or in transitory periods (e.g. start or end of a work/school period).

The benefit of this is simply not having to remember a million tasks in your head. There’s a huge amount of ‘carrying cost’ to store tasks, reminders, and to-dos in one’s head and it’s often times incredibly relieving to just sort of write them down and remove them from one’s internal memory storage. Use this list <INSERT LINK> as a starting point for your brain dump. 

### If you live a more free-form life…

These past few months have been interesting simply because I have 8 months off to make progress on whatever goals I see fit. This has required more free-form goal planning, with screenshots of the process below:

### Other great resources

* This guide goes hand in hand with my Time Organization Guide. If you don’t have an adequate sense of the time you have, your goal-setting can only go so far and vice versa. As a next step, I’d recommend checking it out here. 

* I’ve also written a Productivity Guide, which is best read after reading the Time Organization Guide and the Goal Organization Guide.

* Another great resource on this topic is the legendary ‘Getting Things Done’ book.
