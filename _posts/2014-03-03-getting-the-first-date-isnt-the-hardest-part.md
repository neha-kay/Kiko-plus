Getting the first date isn't the hardest part; it's finding a reason to continue meeting up that is. One off meetups are easy; translating that into a series of n + 1 meetings is hard. 

### A Thought Experiment

Say you‚Äôre at a coffee shop and meet someone really cool who could totally be a potential dating partner. But you‚Äôve only talked to this person for a total of 5 minutes, so you don't _really_ know that much about his/her values and whether he/she is truly a great romantic match. 

### You have a couple options:

#### 1. Have a great 1st interaction and not do anything from there.

Because that's the easier, less scary thing to do. 

This has the obvious downside of not getting into a relationship with a potentially awesome person. 

#### 2. Be super forward and ask them to go on a date with you.

This is a fairly workable option, though saddled with a bunch of key downsides:

__1. It requires a crapton of confidence and courage.__

Which frankly very few of us have, especially when faced with super attractive people who we could potentially see dating. 

__2. Asking someone on a date automatically involves unwanted expectations.__

Suddenly, what would have been a casual hangout, becomes a huge affair. 

_"What should I wear? Should I tell them weird thing X, Y, or Z about myself?"_

By asking this person on a date, you then involve a set of unwanted expectations associated with dating versus seeing them in a natural setting/as they are in daily life. It adds a crapton of awkwardness to the mix and encourages both people to be less themselves than they‚Äôd naturally be.

__3. After a couple dates, it‚Äôs significantly harder to cut off the potential relationship without hurting the other person‚Äôs feelings.__

People take rejection (_especially_ romantic rejection) very seriously. 

Plus, who wants to be the jerk to give them that rejection anyway?

__4. If you‚Äôve cut off the relationship, it‚Äôs even harder to remain friends afterwards.__

Like I said ‚Äì people take rejection pretty personally. The ability to turn someone down without hurting their ego is a rare and hard to cultivate skill. 

### So both these options kind of suck üòï

The ideal option would be having some sort of <strong></strong>><i> grace period </strong></i> where you can interact with the person as they are naturally, without the expectations of a relationship. This grace period would ideally be 3-5 hangouts.

### The Grace Period

Let‚Äôs formalize this notion and call this 3rd option a __Grace Period__, defined as a period in which you can decide whether to pursue someone romantically while seeing their true selves and feeling comfortable revealing _your_ true self without extraneous expectations getting in the way. Effectively, a casual, friendly hangout. 

Having one solves most of the problems above: 

1.	It requires far less courage to ask someone to casually hangout.
2.	Each person can be more or less themselves in the context of a casual hangout.
3.	You can easily cut off the grace period.
4.	It‚Äôs incredibly easy to remain friends afterwards, even if you realize they aren‚Äôt a proper romantic match.
5.	It creates a low pressure way to exchange contact info (and stalk their Facebook profile muwahaha).

### Okay, but how would you implement this? 

Of course, the important question is how to go about implementing this smoothly and I've offered 3 solutions below: 

#### 1. Offer to be each other's accountability buddies 

If you're friends with me you probably know how much I love accountability and the beauty that results from two people checking in on each other's achievement of goals. 

Everyone has _some_ kind of goal. You can suggest meeting up every week to check on each others‚Äô progress; after checking up, take time to get to know each other as friends. 

##### How I‚Äôd implement this:

1.	Super enthusiastically talk about a couple side projects I‚Äôm working on.
2.	Ask if they have some sort of goal they‚Äôre working towards - most people do. And if they‚Äôre reasonably interested in you, even if they don‚Äôt have a project per se, they‚Äôre still likely to agree to the idea of meeting up to set up a goal.
3.	Suggest we casually meet up to check up on each other‚Äôs goals for a __specified period of time__ (e.g. twice in the following month). It‚Äôs important to set an end date because you can always suggest meeting up after that period is over, but it‚Äôs much harder to stop a set of meetings, and is, in some sense, you going back on your word.

#### 2. Identify a common interest and suggest meeting up on account of that common interest.

Scan in the conversation for potential hangouts you guys could both do together in a purely friendly context. This could be going to a technology speaking event or an open-mic night. This option will take a bit of digging around / conversing to figure out what this person likes doing in his/her free time.

##### How I‚Äôd implement this:

1.	I‚Äôd probably ask what they do for fun and see if there‚Äôs any overlap / things we could both casually do. 
2.	Once I‚Äôve found something, I‚Äôd likely say something generic like ‚ÄúI think I read about a speaker event coming up. . .if you‚Äôre interested in technology, we should go!‚Äù 
3. Later, I'd do research to find one in town (LOL) and send them the details. 

#### 3. Figure out a way you can help them or they can help you.

Scan in the conversation for potential areas which they need help in which you could provide some sort of in-person service ‚Äì then offer it! The same goes for the other way around (ways they can help you).
