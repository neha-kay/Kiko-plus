Getting the first date isn't the hardest part; it's getting the n + 1 date -- in finding a reason to continue meeting up.

Say you’re at a coffee shop and meet someone who seems really cool and could totally be a potential dating partner. But you’ve only talked to this person for a total of 5 minutes, so honestly, what do you really know about him/her and his/her values? 

So at this point, you have a couple options:

### 1. Have a great first interaction and not do anything from there 

Because that's the easier, less scary thing to do. This has the obvious downside of not getting into a relationship with a potentially awesome person. 

### 2. Be super forward and ask them to go on a date with you

This is a fairly workable option though saddled with a bunch of key downsides:

#### 1. It requires a crapton of confidence and courage

Which frankly very few of us have, especially when faced with super attractive people who we could potentially see dating. 

#### 2. Asking someone on a date automatically involves unwanted expectations

Suddenly the whole affair becomes a huge thing. What should I wear? Should I tell them weird thing X, Y, or Z about myself? By asking this person on a date, you then involve a whole bunch of expectations of behavior versus seeing them in a natural setting / as they are in daily life. It adds a crapton of awkwardness to the mix and encourages both people to be less themselves than they’d naturally be.

#### 3. After a couple dates, it’s significantly harder to cut off the potential relationship without hurting the other person’s feelings

People take rejection (especially romantic rejection) very seriously. Plus, who wants to be the jerk to give them that rejection anyway?

#### 4. If you’ve cut off the relationship, it’s even harder to remain friends afterwards 

Like I said – people take rejection pretty personally. The ability to turn someone down without hurting their ego is a rare and hard to cultivate skill. 

### So both these options kind of suck :/ 

The ideal option would be having some sort of grace period where you can interact with the person as they are naturally, without the expectations of a relationship. This grace period would ideally be at least 3-5 hangouts.

Let’s formalize this notion and call this 3rd option a Grace Period --- defined as a period in which you can decide whether to pursue someone romantically or not while seeing their true selves, while being able to reveal your true self, without any impeding expectations getting in the way. Having one solves most all of the problems above: 
1.	It requires far less courage to ask someone to casually hangout 
2.	Each person can be more or less themselves in the context of a casual hangout
3.	You can easily cut off the grace period– see explanation below 
4.	It’s incredibly easy to remain friends afterwards, even if you realize they aren’t a proper romantic match
5.	It creates a low pressure way to exchange contact info (and Facebook profiles to stalk! Muwahaha)

## Ways of achieving a grace period?

### 1. Offer to be each other's accountability buddies 

If you're friends with me you probably know how much I love accountability and the beauty that results from two people checking in on each other on the achievement of each person's goals. You can suggest meeting up every week to check on each others’ progress; after checking up, you can always chat and get to know each other as friends. 

##### How I’d implement this:

1.	Super enthusiastically talk about a couple side projects I’m working on
2.	Ask if they have some sort of goal they’re working towards
a.	Usually people will have some sort of project or a desire to do a project. If they’re reasonably interested in you, even if they don’t have a project per se, they’re still likely to agree to the idea of meeting up to set up a goal.
3.	Suggest we casually meet up to check up on each other’s goals for a specified time – say the next month. I think it’s important to set an end date because you can always suggest meeting up after that period is over, but it’s much harder to stop meeting up.

You can ask him/her to meet up every week to check on each others progress on goals and after you've done that you guys can chat as friends and you can pull out your secret clipboard of partner personality traits and see if that person fits the bill

### 2. Identify a common interest and suggest meeting up on account of that common interest

Scan in the conversation for potential hangouts you guys could both do together in a purely friendly context. This could be going to a technology speaker event or an open-mic night. This option will take a bit of digging around / conversing to figure out what this person likes doing in his/her free time.

How I’d implement this: 

1.	I’d probably ask what they do for fun and see if there’s any overlap / things we could both casually do. 
2.	Once I’ve found something, I’d likely say something generic like “I think I read about a speaker event coming up… if you’re interested in technology, we should go!” 

### 3. Figure out a way you can help them or they can help you

Scan in the conversation for potential areas which they need help in which you could provide some sort of in-person service – then offer it! The same goes for the other way around (ways they can help you).
