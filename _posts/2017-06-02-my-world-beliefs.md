Below are some of my personal world beliefs. These beliefs are very much *The World According to Neha* ; I know they don't hold universally and it isn't my intention to convince anyone of any of them. There're just things I strongly believe in, for better or for worse, rationally or irrationally.

Specifically, these views originate from various sources and schools of thought --  Buddhism to computer science to positive psychology to life experiences. They're here as better insight into who I am and what I believe. I hope they're of some use / provide some insight to you upon reading :) 

With that, here we go!

### Suffering is universal.
Simply put, life is suffering. I know this sounds depressing but it really isn't meant to be. On the contrary, it's meant to acknowledge that life's suffering should be expected and any joy beyond it is a gift, and not the other way around.

This leads to the second belief, that . . .

### Life owes me nothing at all. Nothing whatsoever.
By being born, I'm not entitled to neither a good life nor a happy family nor a great career. If anything, by sheer probability, I'm entitled a disadvantaged life:. At least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. By some miracle, I was born into the 0.10% of the world that has access to internet, a top education, and the comfort of having time and freedom to write this blog.

And yet, in the past, a tragedy will happen in my life and I'd wonder, "why me? Why did this happen to *me*?" This belief is about moving away from that view. This belief is about acknowledging that any sickness or sadness I have, or will get, from cancer to death of loved ones, is simply a part of life, in the way a mouse might be born, might get cancer, and might eventually die. 

Instead of expecting continuous joy and being heartbroken when life happens, this belief is about *expecting* these sad moments as part of life and valuing and appreciating anything beyond guaranteed suffering -- appreciating joy -- realizing it's extraneous and that I'm lucky to even have it.

### My identity is the average of my actions.
Even if I could theoretically be more generous, my defined generosity is the integration of my past giving behavior (or lack thereof). 

This notion has a pretty impactful corollary: 

### Contrary to popular belief, identities are dynamic and changed over tim, with the integration of controllable action.
Labels which characterize our self-identity - for example 'extrovert' or 'introvert' - are simply determined by the integration of action over time. By this logic, changing our identities is relatively straightforward; it's a simple matter of changing my actions at time *t* and beyond. Over time, if I continue those actions, the integration of those behaviors generate the label, not the other way around. 

In the same way a smoker becomes a non-smoker, by, day by day, not smoking, an intorvert can become an extrovert by, day by day, going out to events more, reaching out to more people, etc.,

Indeed a 60 year old impatient man, can be patient, of course if he decides to embody traits of patience at time t, t+1, etc.,

In this way, changing an identity is __way__ simpler and straightforward than we originally think; it's a matter of changing small, daily action that is entirely independent of past action and entirely dependent on present motive.

### All is well that ends well, and if it's not well, it's not the end.
Call me irrational or call me an optimist. I don't care, it's what I believe :P :D

### 90% of things are Google-able
If you've studied computer science or have seriously coded at any point in your life, you too, know that 90% of things are Google-able, given a requisite amount of patience, grit, and Stack Overflow. This one skill -- of being confident of finding a solution before you've done so --- is so, so powerful and makes the frustration of learning CS oh so worth it.

### There's always more to learn, always more to improve on.
I am obsessed with self-improvement -- always have been, always will be. I fundamentally believe no matter how awesome I am (or not am), there is always more to improve on, always more to learn. Maybe I'm not the most generous person now, BUT if I wanted to be, I *totally could*. I don't think this obsession with self-improvement will ever change.

### Perception is just as important as objective measurement and often needs to be actively managed. 
Victor Cheng puts it beautifully here:

> > In the Olympics and many other sporting events, you don’t need to worry about perceptions. Your performance is measured down to the hundredths of a second. It is objective.  
> >
> > However, business is different. Ideas and perception of ideas are subject to the influence of human psychology and sociology. 
> >	
> > To be successful in business (and in any subjective endeavor), you need to both BE and be PERCEIVED as competent. 
> >
> > If your perceived competence < your actual competence, then you know how frustrating this can be. This is especially a problem if you’re young, a woman in a male-dominated field, an ethnic minority, or come from a non-Tier 1 school in a field full of Ivy League graduates.
> >
> > Conversely, don’t think that by just merely getting more competent that perceptions will follow. If you are male, white (at least in the United States), a Harvard graduate, and haven’t damaged your reputation yet, then yes, perception of competence will often increase with actual competence. 
> >
> > __If you’re anyone else, perceptions don’t always automatically follow reality. Sometimes you need to take an active role in managing perceptions. Sometimes you need to make developing your gravitas a priority.__

### You can never approach the limit of positive affirmation in a relationship.
We all love being loved. This reminds me to freely and unabashedly affirm those around me. 

### The way you present an argument is just as important as the argument itself.
As they say, a spoonful of honey catches more flies than a gallon of vinegar. This reminds me to forgo the temptation of winning a debate or becoming argumentative in favor of a more effective method of convincing someone.

### People are not statically 'mean or 'kind'; over time, you can change the way people act towards you by changing how you act towards them.
Or as Gretchen Rubin puts it, I can’t make another change, but when I change, a relationship changes.

### As a leader, everything is your fault.
For me, being a leader comes down to 100% ownership. People aren't getting along? Your fault - you should have done more team-bonding activities or something to create a better culture. A major project fell through? Your fault, you should have assigned it to someone with more commitment to making it happen. 

### Deep, seemingly intractable problems are often entirely solvable or manageable. 
There are two possible views on seemingly intractable problems:

*"I've decided my acne is never going away"*
or
*"I've come to terms with the fact that I'm going to be insecure about X / have low self-esteem in that area"*

versus

*"I know there's a solution to my acne. I just have to find it. I may have to try 30 products to find The One, but it's surely out there"*
or
*"I know I'm super insecure about X/have low self-esteem about it. And there is a way to get over it. I'll probably have to read a hundred books to find the 1 page that explains it, but in any case, the solution is out there -- I just have to dedicate the time to find it."*

I strongly believe in the latter - that solutions do exist for really hard problems -- it's just a matter -sometimes years -- of finding them.
