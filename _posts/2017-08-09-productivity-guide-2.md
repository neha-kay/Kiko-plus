### Welcome! 

If you're the type of person who gets an idea and actually has the willpower/internal motivation/discipline to get it done ---- then great! You can X right out of this guide because you really don't need it. 

But if you're someone like me, who has a ton of projects and ideas but little motivation to follow through and actually do, then this guide is for you. 

### Who I am.
Maybe you're thinking, _who are you to write a productivity guide_? And honestly, I'm nobody; I am neither the most productive person nor a timeless sage on the topic. 

That being said, I *do* have a knack for getting beyond my natural laziness/lack of self-discipline to actually get things done.

I generally have a ton of projects I love the _idea_ of doing, but on a day-to-day implementation level, have little motivation to follow through. After all, there are *a lot* of things that can or should be done that help our careers but we just don't really do them. In these cases, the lack of internal motivation holds us back from actually doing the things we need to do. 

This system, however, has allowed me to get around that, and actually _do_ these projects. This includes doing the hardest introduction to coding, Harvard's CS 50 course as a side project while doing a full courseload at Oxford University, waking up at an average of 8:30 am in college despite being a senior with a good number of job offers and a natural tendency to sleep in to 10:30 or 11 am, and following through on side projects like this blog, making progress on a $7,500 scholarship, and a number of other things that needed to get done. 

### What this guide is for. 
Specifically, this guide has 4 parts, all of which are pretty essential:

1. An Accountability System --- to get beyond one's natural laziness/lack of self-discipline to actually get valuable projects done.

2. A Time Organization Guide --- to simply be more organized with your time and to develop a solid time organization system.

3. A Goal Organization Guide --- a system to organize macro-level and day-to-day goals within whatever time constraint you have.  

4. A compiled list of useful tidbits of advice --- I've read a *lot* of things on productivity --- some great, some absolute crap. At the end of this article I've included a running list of great tips, resources, and links curated from other top sources to create a centralized productivity resource. 

### What this guide isn't for.

##### This guide isn't a quick skim or a list of 10 tips. 

This guide is not a quick list of 10 top tricks you can do -- it's a long-form description of 2 organization systems -- Goal and Time Organization -- and 1 getting-shit-done system --- the Accountability framework. Getting through the full guide will likely take an hour or two and setting up the system will take a bit more. Proceed only if you’re willing to put in that time. 

##### This guide isn't a cure-all. 

Everyone responds to expectations and work differently --- that's why there are _so_ many different organization systems and productivity guides out there. Which means there's a chance the solutions below don't work for you. 

Gretchen Rubin describes __4 different categories in which people fall into based on how they respond to expectations__: 

1. __Upholders__ meet both *inner and outer expectations*. 

In other words, if an upholder is assigned a work project (an outer expectation, held by his boss), they'll surely get it done and get it done on time. If they make a commitment to *themselves* (an inner expectation) to make progress on a personal project, they'll follow through on that too. Example: Hermione Granger.

2. __Obligers__ meet *outer expectations but not inner expectations*. 

Most people are obligers. If an obliger is asked to turn in an assignment by X date and time, they'll surely turn it in by then. But if they give *themselves* an assignment by X date and time, they simply won't do it. They only follow through when there's some sort of *external accountability* present.
	
3. __Questioners__ follow through on all expectations which *make sense to them*. 

They're constantly asking 'why' and digging 5 levels deeper into things to fully understand them before accepting or following through. In other words, if they want to do something, they will, only if they fully understand why they're doing the task at hand.  

4. __Rebels__ *resist both inner and outer expectations*. 

They hate being told what to do and often times giving them a directive will make them disobey. When they do choose to follow through on something, it's because they genuinely want to do something or because they feel it's an important component of their identity. Example: Steve Jobs. 

__This guide is written very much for obligers, and to some extent, questioners_. If you're an upholder or rebel, this guide is likely *not* for you. 

##### This guide isn't about building motivation or self-control.

Is it possible to build self-discipline or motivation? I have no idea. What I **do** know is that developing self-discipline, self-control, or perseverance is __hard__ and takes time. Time that we don't have when we have X, Y, and Z project to complete to further our careers. 

Instead, this guide is more about accepting one's lack of internal motivation and __still__ getting stuff done by changing one's environment through self-imposed accountability. 

### Let's get started! 

A good place to start is in deconstructing unproductivity --- by thinking through the environments in which we are most productive versus the ones in which we are not. 

### Deconstructing Unproductivity
I think we can all admit our most productive intervals happen in the context of either __work__ or __school__. Analyzing why this is the case can provide further insight into creating this kind of environment for personal projects. 

__Why do we tend to get an enormous amount of work done at work and school despite having little internal motivation to do so?__

I’d argue it’s for 3 chief reasons:

#### 1. Clarity in what needs to be done.

When we’re not sure what needs to be done on a school assignment or problem set, we ask the professor or the TA until we have a clear sense of what needs to be done. In a work context, we’d ask our bosses or colleagues what a deliverable entails if there’s any amount of confusion. This clarity then allows us to better deconstruct a goal or deliverable into more actionable tasks that we then proceed to work on. 

#### 2. Clarity in when a deliverable is due.

If our boss or professor hasn’t provided a deadline for a deliverable, it tends to get put on the backburner in favor of other action items.

More on this later, but suffice to say, having a clear notion of when something is due increases the likelihood it will be completed soon. Indeed deadlines can be incredibly motivating. 

#### 3. The presence and awareness of consequences if an action item isn’t done.

In the context of school, these consequences of non-action present themselves as really bad grades (a consequence of not studying). In the context of work, these consequences present themselves as a lack of respect from co-workers, a lower work evaluation, letting others down, etc., In both cases, the consequences are both A) understood beforehand and B) pretty severe. 

__Thus, unproductivity can be distilled into the following 3 elements:__

#### I. A lack of clarity of what needs to be done.
#### II. A lack of clarity of the time one has to set aside for a task.
#### III. A lack of accountability: a deadline and a set of consequences if a deliverable isn’t done on time.
