### Welcome! 

This is yet another productivity guide. 

And maybe you're thinking, _who are you to write a productivity guide_? And honestly, I'm nobody; I am neither the most productive person nor a timeless sage on the topic. 

_That being said, I have a knack for getting beyond my natural laziness/lack of self-discipline to actually get things done._

If you're the type of person who gets an idea and actually has the willpower/internal motivation/discipline to get it done ---- then great! You can X right out of this guide because you really don't need it. 

But if you're someone like me, who has a ton of projects and ideas but little motivation to follow through and actually do, then this guide is for you. 

I generally have a ton of projects I love the _idea_ of doing, but on a day-to-day implementation level, have little motivation to follow through. This system, however, has allowed me to get around that, and actually _do_ these projects. 

This includes doing the hardest introduction to coding, Harvard's CS 50 course as a side project while doing a full courseload at Oxford University, waking up at an average of 8:30 am in college despite being a senior with a good number of job offers and a natural tendency to sleep in to 10:30 or 11 am, and following through on side projects like this blog, a 7,500 scholarship, and a number of other things. 

Fundamentally, this guide seeks to answer: 
__How can I get beyond my natural laziness/lack of self-discipline to actually get valuable projects done?__
