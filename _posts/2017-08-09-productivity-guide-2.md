### Welcome! 

If you're the type of person who gets an idea and actually has the willpower/internal motivation/discipline to get it done ---- then great! You can X right out of this guide because you really don't need it. 

But if you're someone like me, who has a ton of projects and ideas but little motivation to follow through and actually do, then this guide is for you. 

### Who I am.
Maybe you're thinking, _who are you to write a productivity guide_? And honestly, I'm nobody; I am neither the most productive person nor a timeless sage on the topic. 

That being said, I *do* have a knack for getting beyond my natural laziness/lack of self-discipline to actually get things done.

I generally have a ton of projects I love the _idea_ of doing, but on a day-to-day implementation level, have little motivation to follow through. After all, there are *a lot* of things that can or should be done that help our careers but we just don't really do them. In these cases, the lack of internal motivation holds us back from actually doing the things we need to do. 

This system, however, has allowed me to get around that, and actually _do_ these projects. This includes doing the hardest introduction to coding, Harvard's CS 50 course as a side project while doing a full courseload at Oxford University, waking up at an average of 8:30 am in college despite being a senior with a good number of job offers and a natural tendency to sleep in to 10:30 or 11 am, and following through on side projects like this blog, making progress on a $7,500 scholarship, and a number of other things that needed to get done. 

### What this guide is for. 
Specifically, this guide has 4 parts, all of which are pretty essential:

1. An Accountability System --- to get beyond one's natural laziness/lack of self-discipline to actually get valuable projects done.

2. A Time Organization Guide --- to simply be more organized with your time and to develop a solid time organization system.

3. A Goal Organization Guide --- a system to organize macro-level and day-to-day goals within whatever time constraint you have.  

4. A compiled list of useful tidbits of advice --- I've read a *lot* of things on productivity --- some great, some absolute crap. At the end of this article I've included a running list of great tips, resources, and links curated from other top sources to create a centralized productivity resource. 

### What this guide isn't for.

##### This guide isn't a quick skim or a list of 10 tips. 

This guide is not a quick list of 10 top tricks you can do -- it's a long-form description of 2 organization systems -- Goal and Time Organization -- and 1 getting-shit-done system --- the Accountability framework. Getting through the full guide will likely take an hour or two and setting up the system will take a bit more. Proceed only if you’re willing to put in that time. 

##### This guide isn't a cure-all. 

Everyone responds to expectations and work differently --- that's why there are _so_ many different organization systems and productivity guides out there. Which means there's a chance the solutions below don't work for you. 

Gretchen Rubin describes __4 different categories in which people fall into based on how they respond to expectations__: 

1. __Upholders__ meet both *inner and outer expectations*. 

In other words, if an upholder is assigned a work project (an outer expectation, held by his boss), they'll surely get it done and get it done on time. If they make a commitment to *themselves* (an inner expectation) to make progress on a personal project, they'll follow through on that too. Example: Hermione Granger.

2. __Obligers__ meet *outer expectations but not inner expectations*. 

Most people are obligers. If an obliger is asked to turn in an assignment by X date and time, they'll surely turn it in by then. But if they give *themselves* an assignment by X date and time, they simply won't do it. They only follow through when there's some sort of *external accountability* present.
	
3. __Questioners__ follow through on all expectations which *make sense to them*. 

They're constantly asking 'why' and digging 5 levels deeper into things to fully understand them before accepting or following through. In other words, if they want to do something, they will, only if they fully understand why they're doing the task at hand.  

4. __Rebels__ *resist both inner and outer expectations*. 

They hate being told what to do and often times giving them a directive will make them disobey. When they do choose to follow through on something, it's because they genuinely want to do something or because they feel it's an important component of their identity. Example: Steve Jobs. 

__This guide is written very much for obligers, and to some extent, questioners_. If you're an upholder or rebel, this guide is likely *not* for you. 

##### This guide isn't about building motivation or self-control.

Is it possible to build self-discipline or motivation? I have no idea. What I **do** know is that developing self-discipline, self-control, or perseverance is __hard__ and takes time. Time that we don't have when we have X, Y, and Z project to complete to further our careers. 

Instead, this guide is more about accepting one's lack of internal motivation and __still__ getting stuff done by changing one's environment through self-imposed accountability. 

### Let's get started! 

A good place to start is in deconstructing unproductivity --- by thinking through the environments in which we are most productive versus the ones in which we are not. 

### Deconstructing Unproductivity
I think we can all admit our most productive intervals happen in the context of either __work__ or __school__. Analyzing why this is the case can provide further insight into creating this kind of environment for personal projects. 

__Why do we tend to get an enormous amount of work done at work and school despite having little internal motivation to do so?__

I’d argue it’s for 3 chief reasons:

#### 1. Clarity in what needs to be done.

When we’re not sure what needs to be done on a school assignment or problem set, we ask the professor or the TA until we have a clear sense of what needs to be done. In a work context, we’d ask our bosses or colleagues what a deliverable entails if there’s any amount of confusion. This clarity then allows us to better deconstruct a goal or deliverable into more actionable tasks that we then proceed to work on. 

#### 2. Clarity in when a deliverable is due.

If our boss or professor hasn’t provided a deadline for a deliverable, it tends to get put on the backburner in favor of other action items.

More on this later, but suffice to say, having a clear notion of when something is due increases the likelihood it will be completed soon. Indeed deadlines can be incredibly motivating. 

#### 3. The presence and awareness of consequences if an action item isn’t done.

In the context of school, these consequences of non-action present themselves as really bad grades (a consequence of not studying). In the context of work, these consequences present themselves as a lack of respect from co-workers, a lower work evaluation, letting others down, etc., In both cases, the consequences are both A) understood beforehand and B) pretty severe. 

__Thus, unproductivity can be distilled into the following 3 elements:__

#### I. A lack of clarity of what needs to be done.
The Goal Organization Guide focuses on this.

#### II. A lack of clarity of the time one has to set aside for a task.
The Time Organization Guide focuses on this. 

#### III. A lack of accountability: a deadline and a set of consequences if a deliverable isn’t done on time.

This guide focuses on this, through the introduction of accountability sprints, as a vehicle for counteracting unproductivity. 

### Accountability as a solution for unproductivity.

Accountability is the __invisible magical force that gets us to be productive in school and work despite lackluster motivation__. 

Sure, we end up working right up till the deadline and the night before, but __we get it done__. 

##### Accountability involves 3 aspects:

* A strict deadline.
* A set of consequences if a deliverable isn’t completed on time.
* A figure of authority enforcing the deadline and consequences.

By nature, our home environments and personal projects lack all 3 of these elements. 

As a result, these projects get ignored when in competition with work or school deadlines. 

Why? Because the latter has strict consequences for incompletion and a deadline, both of which we know will be enforced, unlike our personal projects which are er. . . more *flexible*. 

### Using accountability to get things done. 

So the solution is fairly simple: we need to introduce these elements into the achievement of our personal projects. 

The crux of this system is having a friend hold us accountable to 'turning in' a set of deliverables to them by a specified date. If we don't, we have to pay up the pre-determined consequences.

To do this, we need the following elements: 

#### I. An *Accountability Buddy* who’s willing to hold you accountable.

This friend needs to be willing to enforce a deadline and a set of consequences.

**Make sure your friend isn't *too* close to you that they'll let you off the hook easily.**

Sometimes, our friends are so close to us that they transform into inner expectations. **If your friend/loved one is likely to let you off the hook if you don't perform well, find someone else to hold you accountable**. If you're serious about getting things done, you have to be serious about the consequences if you *don't* get something done. 

#### II. Strict, pre-agreed upon consequences if deliverables are not done by a given time or by a certain standard.

What motivates you to get something done? Use that as a consequence. 

** Financial incentives (e.g. paying a friend $10) work *really* well here. Why?**

Simple. Because it makes you more likely to do it. 

Sometimes the shame of not meeting a promise is sufficient -- it really depends on what motivates you personally and what impact your friend’s view of you has on you and your motivation. Try it without money if you’re curious, ideally with someone who’s opinion of you matters to you. If that doesn’t work though, money almost always will ;)

If you think you might be unwilling to *actually* pay if you fail to meet the deadline or deliverable standard, you can *pay your friend* in the beginning (when setting up the accountability sprint) and have them return you the money only when you've met the standards. This is a lot less awkward than forcing your friend to make you pay them money.

#### III. Explicitly written tangible deliverables with fail-proof ways of measuring success.

More explicit deliverables make it easier to check if you've *actually* followed through on what you intended to do. 

Your friend won't *truly* be able to measure your success if your deliverable is, "study for Calculus test" or "read up on starting a startup". 

Making the deliverable more specific, like "Read chapters 7-10" is better, but still sub-par; how will your friend *truly* check if you've read? 

Instead, setting a deliverable of "Done problems 1-30 on pages 400, 450, and 438 each (90 problems)" or "Read and took notes on chapters 7-10" are far better. 

#### IV. Explicitly written form of submission. 

What format is the deliverable? Some good examples: 

* _An email containing 4 graphs . . ._
* _A URL to X, Y, Z finished articles . . ._
* _A Fitbit heart-rate tracking graph as proof I exercised for 20 minutes_
* _A screenshot of 20 sent networking emails_

#### V. Explicitly written deadlines.

This one's pretty easy --- something along the lines of *11:59 pm EST +/- 5 minutes*.

It's generally a good idea to include a 5 minute grace period. The last thing you want is to lose $20 because you finished something 1 minute late. 

## Implementing an Accountability Sprint.

Cool. Now that we have the ingredients of our accountability framework, we're ready for an:

* **Accountability Sprint** --- a period of time when your friend is holding you to a deadline, and you're in the productive zone of 'sprinting' to meet the deadline and deliverable standards and avoid the negative consequences.
* **Accountability Declaration** --- this is the formal write-up of the deliverables, due date, and consequences that you'll message or email your Accountability buddy. 

To give you a better sense of how to implement this **well**, I'll run through an example of converting a bad Accountability Declaration into a good one. I'd recommend you take a moment now to figure out what you're trying to work towards and have a draft that you can modify as you read through this. 

### Setting up an Accountability Declaration

#### A Bad Declaration
I’ll email you statistics on distribution of wage/salary income of people with college degrees in metropolitan centers. 

##### Why it's Bad | Vague
So what exactly does checking for *distribution of wage/salary income" mean? How do you quantifiy *statistics* into something checkable? How many metropolitan centers? There's a lot of ambiguity that creates unnecessary wiggle room.

##### Why it’s Bad | No Time
There’s no due date associated with the task. By when? What time? You want the accountability declaration to be as specific as possible so that there’s absolutely no wiggle room (unless pre-outlined) on your end. 

##### Why it’s Bad | No Deliverable
What tangible element is the friend going to check for? It's unclear.

##### Why it’s Bad | Too Esoteric
It’s not in layman/easy-to-check terms. 

Unless your friend is a labor economics and statistics expert, she’s going to have a _really_ hard time figuring out if you *really* did all of the items above. And if (s)he's not sure, most people will likely let you off the hook, which is really bad because it compromises the integrity of the system. 

Plus, you irritate your friend by asking them to parse through rather dense material, rather than giving them an easy set of things to check for.

#### How to Improve It:
A better accountability declaration would be the following: 

Overall Topic: Distribution of wage/salary income

**Deliverable I: 4 bar graphs of the distribution of wage/salary income of Americans.**
* Delivery method: A PDF report, sent via email. 
* Rubric: Check all 4 bar graphs are there, emailed on time, complete with detailed legend and a short paragraph explaining the data.
* Consequence/Due Date: $10 penalty paid by Venmo if not emailed by 11:59 pm EST.

** Deliverable II. A set of 4 mean, median, and quartile information blocks for each of the graphs** 
* Delivery method: Sent in body of email.
* Rubric: Check all 4 sets of data are there (12 in total), emailed on time.
* Consequence/Due Date: $5 penalty for each of the 12 data blocks, paid by Venmo if not emailed by 11:59 pm EST.

Do you see what a **huge** change in specificity that is from the original declaration? Specifically, we parsed ambiguous terms like "statistics" into very checkable elements (mean, median, mode information blocks) along with fixing all the problems listed above.

## A template for Accountability Declarations

Use the following template when writing out declarations and mirror the specificity of the example above when writing Accountability Declarations: 

Overall Topic:

Deliverable I:
* Delivery method:  
* Rubric: 
* Consequence/Due Date: 

## Other Important Implementation Tips

##### Aim for week long accountability sprints, not longer  (at least in the beginning).

My accountability sprints are never more than 1-2 weeks long. If you're just starting out, it's *especially* important to have shorter accountability sprints for 2 reasons: 

* If you fail or mess up, you have less money on the line to lose.

I once had a friend who made a month long accountability declaration, got sick which threw him entirely off schedule, and ended up owing upwards of $100 for his missed deadlines. 

With shorter, week-long deadlines you have far less to lose.

* Shorter accountability sprints allow for more fine-tuning. 

The shorter the cycle, the more quickly you can change up what is and isn't working (see the next tip).

* Shorter feedback cycles can be more rewarding.

You meet the deadline quicker and therefore feel the euphoria of accomplishment more often. It's pretty energizing. 

##### Fine-tune your system as you set up further accountability sprints.

Did you over-estimate how much you had to finish the first sprint? Then fix that for the next one. Were you not specific enough in describing deliverables? Fix that in the next one. 

Since your sprints are only 1 week long, you can easily fix something that's off. 

##### Eliminate as much ambiguity and wiggle room in your description of the deliverable as possible. 

The point of accountability declarations is to remove all possible wiggle room.

Why? When we have trouble meeting a deadline, we look for wiggle room. We look for cracks in the veneer, for ambiguity, for the minimum possible we can do to still get credit. That’s just human nature and it’s *totally okay* -- it simply means we have to put in more effort to limiting the wiggle room as much as possible. 

> When I was in college, I desperately wanted to wake up earlier. So I told my friend that I'd send her a photo of a "Hopkins workspace by 8:30 am +/- 5 minutes." The problem with this declaration was that I was able to take a photo of my living room table, masked as a workspace --- this was invisible wiggle room that resulted in me getting to my *real* workspace at 8:45 or 9 am. Instead, the next time around, I became way more specific, pointing out that I'd send her a photo of "Brody reading room" --- aka the actual workspace I meant to be in, thereby getting rid of the ambiguity and wiggle room.

In the last few minutes when you're rushing to meet a deadline, you'll look for all the possible ways you can undercut the deliverable while still getting credit. Acknowledge this habit in the beginning and address it by making water-tight accountability declarations.

## Troubleshooting

##### My friend let me off the hook. Is this really that bad?

Yes. yes. yes. 

When people let you off the hook for missing a deadline or a deliverable standard, it compromises the integrity of the system. 

In the short run, it's good, because you save how much ever money you put on the line. But in the long run, if you know you’ll be off the hook this time, you’ll figure you’ll be off the hook in the future, leaving room for you to slack off in future accountability declarations. This fundamentally compromises the very thing that makes the system work -- an expectation of performance. 

So if you tried it, and it failed, no problem. I'd recommend trying again, making sure you're following all the tips above. 

##### This helps me get work done, but how do I make sure what I'm doing is high quality work? 
We've all experienced that feeling of cramming before a deadline --- heck that may just be a deadline meeting routine for us. The fact of the matter is, **accountability frameworks can guarantee that you'll get something done well, but not necessarily done well.**

Sometimes you can quantify what it means for a deliverable to be done well – for example, specifying “4 bar charts” and further details about the charts, but often, it’s hard to perfectly quantify what our best work is. 

This is a weakness of the accountability framework largely because quality is largely dependent on internal motivation. 

The best way to try and maximize both quantity and quality is to: 

* Perform an accountability sprint to get as much as I can done.
* Once the work is done, go back to add to the quality.
