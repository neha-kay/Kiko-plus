Companies like Boltbus and Megabus are notorious for selling coveted $1 tickets. I’ve gotten a few $1 tickets myself along with some $5 and $9 rides. If you’re aiming for scoring one of these tickets consider the following: 

1. Have a travel window, preferably with weekdays, and check all dates in that travel window across all bus sites on Wanderu. Generally Friday and Sunday travel tend to be more expensive, as well as holidays and weekend times. If you’re able to, searching for a weekday time may yield more golden $1 bus tickets. 

2. Book 31-90 days in advance. According to Megabus’ terms and conditions, the company only gives $1 fares to “the first or initial customers that purchase a ticket for that trip,” while every scheduled Boltbus trip offers at least one $1 fare every day. Busbud analyzed the probability of finding one by analyzing 1 million+ departures. They found the following:

The probability of finding a $1 bus ticket increases when you search a month in advance, hovering near the 4% mark when you search 31 days in advance, and reaches its peak with around the 90 day mark. The data becomes less reliable between 90 and 120 days as fewer people search that far in advance.

Unlike other carriers, Greyhound specifically offers $1 busses only 31 days in advance and not any earlier. 

3. Aim to travel on a Tuesday or Wednesday (but still search all times in your travel window)
According to Busbud, you’re more likely to snag a $1 bus ticket set to travel on a Tuesday ir Wednesday than a Friday or weekend, simply because demand for weekend dates are higher.

4. Join the Dollar Bus Club
The Dollar Bus Club is a free email alert which emails you when a $1 bus fare was found in your city. Pretty neat!
