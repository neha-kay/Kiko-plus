There are a ton of pieces out there on *how to network* and building one’s network. 

But sadly, no one ever seems to talk about the people you have, and more specifically, how to cultivate those relationships, instead of just making more.

Below is a description of how I personally keep in touch with my friends. If you have some ideas you think are uber cool and useful, feel free to share them in the comments section below to add to the idea-sharing.

This guide is split into three sections: 

1.[A bit of background](#background)
2.[The key elements of my system]()
     * How to implement each element

# Background

At first glance, this system is going to seem a bit crazy – the definition of going overboard. 

A lot of the things I’m about to describe may seem a bit crazy. For example, who buys gifts for 20+ people or sends Mailchimp newsletters? 

But I care a lot about maintaining my friendships and I’d argue the craziness of this system is pretty proportional to how much I care about my friends.  Friendship is a pretty strong value for me and therefore, is something I’m willing to spend time, money, and resources on. 

If you end up reading this article, either 1 of 2 things will happen: 

1. You take away some useful elements of the system and implement some portion of them in your life.
2.  You find yourself interested in the idea of implementing it and love imagining having the system, but sort of close the browser and get on with life as is.

I believe the difference in the two action processes comes from your values, specifically the degree to which you’re motivated to maintain your friendships. 

Two years ago, I read Keith Ferrazzi’s book, Never Eat Alone and fell in love with the concept of having a well-maintained network but didn’t do anything substantial to actually work towards it – I just put down the book and let the idea simmer. 

A couple years later, after a spell of loneliness, I realized – hey - friendships are actually freaking incredibly important and the fundamental shift in values led to creating this entire framework. 

# Elements of the System

My mechanism of keeping in touch with friends and maintaining relationships has 5 key components:  

1. [A newsletter](#i-a-newsletter)
2. [Regular videochats / phonechats](#ii-regular-video-and-phone-chats)
3. [Birthday Phone Calls, Emails, & Facebook Messages](#iii-birthday-phone-calls-emails-and-facebook-messages)
4. [Visiting in Person](#iv-visiting-while-in-town)
5. [Miscellaneous Elements](#v-miscellaneous-elements)

## I. A Newsletter

I have a general purpose ‘these are my updates’ newsletter I frequently send out. 

### How to implement this

#### 1. Find your friends

Make a list of everyone you’d ideally like to keep in touch with. You can segment this list into 2 categories: 
	
Category I: The people you consider super close to you – the people who would truly enjoy hearing about your everyday life and how you’re doing
Category II: Friends and acquaintances – people who like you and are interested in you but probably don’t want to hear from you tooooo often. 

These 2 lists of people form the basis of your newsletter; send a 

## II. Regular video and phone chats

The thing about relationships is that life gets in the way of them – all the time and relationships as a result, end up on the backburner. To avoid this, I make a point of scheduling regular phone or video chats with people I genuinely enjoy interacting with. Between my close friends, I’ll usually chat with 1-2 people every week. 

### How to implement this

#### 1. Find your friends

Make a list of friends you genuinely enjoy talking to, who hopefully also enjoy talking to you. Reach out to them to schedule an initial catchup phone chat or video chat. 

### 2. Establish a regular video chat schedule by scheduling the next video chat at the end of the current one

Say you schedule an initial video chat. You have a great time and say bye. Instead of ending the videochat and returning the relationship into stagnant communication waters, schedule the next one then and there. The next video chat could be in 3 months or in 3 weeks, but it helps having a solid reminder to chat. I always point out that we can move around the time closer to the date. 

## III. Birthday Phone Calls, Emails, and Facebook Messages 

I make a point of remembering my friends' birthdays and reaching out to them on their birthdays – either with a personalized email or a quick Facebook message. I think it really goes a long way to do so and there are a number of tools you can use to better remember to reach out to people. 

### How to implement this

Since I have a horrible memory I’ve actually sat down and manually entered calendar reminders of my friends’ birthdays, which pop up on my calendar on the day of. Various reminder tools you can use include:

* Schedule friends’ birthdays in Google Calendar
* Set up a [Zapier]( https://zapier.com/) email notification based on a Google Calendar event
* Apple reminder system

This action has a high startup cost (sitting down and setting up reminders) but zero cost thereafter. 
	
### IV. Visiting While in Town

As soon as you know you’re heading to a city, message the friends you know who live there. Nothing beats an in person meeting, especially if you're willing to treat them to a coffee. If you’re able to organize group hangouts that 

### How to implement this

#### 1. Have a(n organized) sense of where people are located

I maintain a spreadsheet of my friends, which includes a column for ‘city 2017’, allowing me to quickly look up the friends I have in a given city.  

#### 2. If you want to meet people you don’t know too well, make group chats 

A friend (shoutout to you, Nora!) did this when visiting New York from Oxford. I knew her as an acquaintance at Oxford and it would have been a bit of a stretch for her to directly message me to hangout, as we weren’t that close at Oxford.  Instead, she made a group chat with a close friend of mine and I, and on account of the close friend, I was totally down to come. That allowed Nora and I to solidify our friendship further, to the point where, if I was back in Oxford now, I’d be entirely comfortable meeting up with her individually. 

This serves 4 functions:
1. It serves as a more efficient way of hanging out with people, especially if your time in a given city is limited.
2. It allows you to re-connect with people you may feel uncomfortable meeting one-on-one. 
3. It incentivizes people who may not know you too well to feel comfortable meeting up with you
4. It’s less talking pressure –multiple people means it’s easier to listen / not have to talk, if you have an introverted side in you, like me =) 

## V. Miscellaneous Elements

### Don’t be afraid to ask people for advice 

When I have a problem or a quick favor, I’ll usually go ahead and message 5-6 friends and get their input on the matter. The benefit of this is 5 fold: 

1) It sends a message that you value their advice and trust their opinion
2) People love giving advice; it’s almost like an honor to do so. In some sense, you’re giving people a reason to feel great by providing their opinion  
3) It sends a message that they’re important enough to you that you’d reach out to them for advice
4) You get their advice on the matter
5) You create an environment in which they can come to you for advice and you can return the favor to them.

That’s a pretty powerful ROI for one action item. 

My friend recently called me for career advice on whether to accept a return full-time offer at the company she was working at. Over the course of an hour and a half, we worked through the problem and by the end, (I think) I was of help to her and on my end, I surely felt way more connected to her than before. In a sense, it was a double win for her. By the end of the day, she was able to a) get further insight on the issue bothering her at the time b) strengthen the relationship with each person she connected with.  

## Actively Seeking Reasons to Connect

If people post about a new job or life event, I make a point of messaging them a huge *congrats!*, asking about how they’ve been, etc., It’s a great excuse to reach out and say hi.  

## Conclusion

As you can see, maintaining relationships for me is no small matter; it’s an active habit I maintain in life, as important and time consuming as maintaining my health and loving my family. But it sure as heck pays off; I feel secure, loved, and supported and has been very much well worth the effort =)
