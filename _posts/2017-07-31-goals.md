Below are my goals, as of August 2017. Further below are my (self-perceived) progress on each goal, as measured by smiley and frowny faces ğŸ˜›. 


## Macro Level Goals (August 2017)

* Be a giving person, on a regular, day-to-day basis.
* Get addicted to exercising (in a good way).
* Find a life partner.
* Be humble and committed to self-improvement.
* Be forgiving in close relationships.
* Be a good daughter.
* Treat my body like a temple. 
* Regulate emotions better.


## Goals Quantified

Because I believe in clarity and a certain degree of quantification, even with macro level goals, I've included the section below to clarify what the goals above mean. The definitons may vary in precision but I think I have a good sense of assessing myself by them as they are defined below, and I think that's all that matters. What do you think is missing from the list below? Add your list in the comments section for a bit of goal diversity and extra perspective ğŸ™‚. 

#### Be a giving person, on a regular, day-to-day basis.

* Actively listen and scan for opportunities to help others achieve their goals. This could be putting them in touch with a friend, having their resume referred, giving them advice, or sending them a set of links on something they've expressed worry or interest in. It's literally being a radar detector for helping others, in small but meaningful ways. 

* In a work context, if it comes down to individual performance versus generosity, favor generosity. I know I can't generalize this, but as a rule of thumb, erring on the side of helping the team, not the individual.

#### Get addicted to exercising (in a good way).

* Seeing exercise as a part of life, like brushing my teeth or flossing, and not as an (optional) chore or decision. This, I think, comes with doing what it takes to build a habit of exercise. 

#### Find a life partner.

* Actively working on finding a life partner with [the same hustle and tenacity as I'd have starting a business]({% post_url 2017-07-31-society-has-dating-all-wrong %}){:target="_blank"}.

#### Be humble and committed to self-improvement.

* Being aware of the things you struggle with and having 2-3 'areas to improve' in mind in whatever period of time you're in. As you progress, focusing moreso on the next 2-3 things you have to improve in rather than over-celebrating what you've done so far. 

#### Be forgiving in close relationships.

* During moments when it's tempting to not be forgiving/hold a grudge, opt out of that and [avoid carrying negative emotion around unnecessarily]({% post_url 2017-07-31-society-has-dating-all-wrong %}){:target="_blank"} for the sake of yourself and the other person.

#### Be a good daughter.

* Call parents at least once a day

* Buy them an all expenses paid trip to somewhere really, really nice (e.g. Hawaii, Italy, etc.,) once you have a regular paycheck.

#### Treat my body like a temple. 

* Focus on eating healthy to unhealthy foods in a 9:1 ratio.
* Use your posture corrector regularly and focus on having good posture while sitting and standing; taking regular breaks to stretch out your neck.
* Sleep a minimum of 7 hours a day

#### Regulate emotions better.

* Maintaining strong control over emotions and maintaining emotional equanimity in the face of the most stressful and/or painful situations.
