#### I. Use Wanderu!
[Wanderu](https://www.wanderu.com/en/){:target="_blank"} is the Google of bus tickets --- it pulls and sorts options from all major bus providers so you can identify the best ride across ~100+ options instead of ~10 options from searching only on the Greyhound/Megabus/Boltbus site.

On top of that, you can:
* Sort the options for the cheapest/fastest/shortest route
* Select specific carriers
* Include nearby cities
* Adjust the time slider to identify only the busses which leave after a certain time or arrive by a certain time. 

Once you've found a bus, you can either:

* Pay through the site (100% free as of July 2017) 
* Navigate to the company site and book there

While I personally find Wanderu the most versatile, another great option is [BusBud](busbud.com). 

#### II. Booking multiple dates 1-3 months in advance may be cheaper than booking a single date the week of travel

Say you’re traveling from Philadelphia to New York on a weekend 3 months in the future, though you’re not sure which weekend.

1. Check the prices for this weekend, to get a sense of what the cost of a last-minute booking is. 

2. Check the prices for 1-3 months out.

3. If the prices of a ticket 1-3 months out is significantly cheaper (say $1-5 instead of $10-$20) buy multiple tickets for a couple weekends.

Depending on the route, this can actually be _way_ cheaper than booking last minute. If you do this through Megabus, you can later credit the un-used tickets to a future trip. 

### 2. If you travel often, join the rewards programs.

Yes, they're irritating to sign up for but if you travel often (for example if you're a college student), being intentional about your trips can pay off. 

1. Figure out which 
If you make regular trips, signing up for the free accounts pays off. Companies like Greyhound and Boltbus offer free rides and rewards with every ride you buy.

### 4. Snag overnight trips if you can

Since you’ll be asleep a majority of the time you won’t even realize how much time you’ve been on the bus. Plus, you avoid paying for a hotel for that night ;)
