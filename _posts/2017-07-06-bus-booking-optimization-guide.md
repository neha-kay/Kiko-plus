A guide on how to optimize the bus booking process.

The Bus Booking Optimization Guide starts here with the following 3 parts: 

* Part 1: The Basics of Bus Booking Optimization
* Part 2: [How to Score $1 Bus Tickets](https://neha-kay.github.io/2017-07-06/how-to-score-1-bus-tickets/)
* Part 3: [How to Optimize Bus Bookings by Carrier](https://neha-kay.github.io/2017-07-06/how-to-optimize-bus-bookings-by-carrier/)

Let’s get started! 

## The Basics of Bus Booking Optimization

### 1.Use Wanderu instead of searching on the Greyhound/Megabus/Boltbus site itself

[Wanderu](https://www.wanderu.com/en/) is the Google of bus tickets -- it pulls and sorts options from all major bus providers so you can identify the cheapest/fastest/shortest across 100+ options instead of a few from 1 bus company. 

Moreover, you can sort the options, select specific carriers, include nearby cities, and even adjust the time slider to identify only the busses which leave after a certain time or arrive by a certain time. 

Once you've found a bus, you can either 

* Pay through the site (100% free as of July 2017) 
* Navigate to the company site and book there


While I personally find Wanderu the most versatile, another great option is [BusBud](busbud.com). 

### 2. Booking multiple dates 1-3 months in advance may be cheaper than a single date later on

Say you’re traveling from Philadelphia to New York on a weekend 3 months in the future, though you’re not sure which weekend.

1. Check the prices for this weekend, to get a sense of what the cost of a last-minute booking is. 

2. Check the prices for 1-3 months out and consider buying tickets for a couple weekends

Chances are this might be cheaper than buying one ticket last-minute, as prices tend to increase as you get closer to the travel date. If you book on Megabus, you can always credit the un-used tickets to a future trip. 

### 2. If you travel often, make sure you join the rewards programs

If you make regular trips, signing up for the free accounts pays off. Companies like Greyhound and Boltbus offer free rides and rewards with every ride you buy. 

###### Greyhound Rewards

| 8 roundtrip tickets   | Free trip anywhere   |    |


###### Boltbus Rewards

### 4. Snag overnight trips if you can

Since you’ll be asleep a majority of the time you won’t even realize how much time you’ve been on the bus. Plus, you avoid paying for a hotel for that night ;)
