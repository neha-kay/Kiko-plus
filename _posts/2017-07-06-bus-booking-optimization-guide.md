A guide on how to optimize the bus booking process.

This guide has 3 sections:

Part 1: The Basics of Bus Booking Optimization
Part 2: How to Score $1 Bus Tickets
Part 3: How to Optimize Bus Choices by Bus Carrier

Let’s get started! 

The Basics of Bus Booking Optimization

1.Use Wanderu instead of searching on Greyhound/Megabus/Boltbus site

Wanderu is the Google of bus tickets -- it pulls and sorts options from all major bus providers so you can truly identify the cheapest/fastest/shortest, etc., across 100 options instead of 10 from 1 particular bus company. You can sort the options, select specific carriers, include nearby cities, and even adjust the ‘time slider’ in case you need busses that only leave after a certain time or arrive by a certain time. You can either a) pay through the site (100% free as of July 2017) or b) navigate to the company site after identifying it as the best bus. Way better than booking on a Greyhound or Megabus site =) 

While I personally find Wanderu the most versatile, another great similar search engine is BusBud. 

3. Booking multiple dates 1-3 months in advance may be cheaper than a single date later

Say you’re traveling to New York from Philadelphia on a weekend 3 months later, but you’re not sure which weekend.

First, check the prices for this weekend, to get a sense of what the cost of a last-minute booking is. 

Then, check the prices for 1-3 months out and consider buying tickets for a couple weekends; chances are this might be cheaper than buying them last-minute, as prices tend to increase as you get closer to the travel date. If you book on Megabus, you can always credit the un-used tickets to a future trip. 

2. If you travel often make an account and join the rewards programs

If you make regular trips, signing up for the free accounts pays off; companies like Greyhound and Boltbus offer free rides and rewards with every ride you buy. 

Greyhound Rewards
15% off next ticket with 3 roundtrip tickets + buy one get one free for a friend
20% off next ticket with 5 roundtrip tickets + buy one get one free for a friend
Free trip anywhere with 8 roundtrip tickets 

Boltbus Rewards
Take 8 trips, get 1 free

4. Snag overnight trips if you can.

Since you’ll be asleep a majority of the time you won’t even realize how much time you’ve been on the bus. Plus, you avoid paying for a hotel for that night ;)
