# 30 Days of Daily Musings

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Disqus + Google Analytics | July 10, 2017 </h3>

Disqus & Google Analytics are officially working! It’s amazing how small achievements seem after you’ve done them and how big tasks seem before you’ve achieved them. 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> I'll Buy You a Beer | July 4, 2017 </h3>

I really love the concept of buying someone a beer. It's way cheaper than buying them a meal, makes me feel like sexism isn't a thing, and has a friendly undertone, compared to 'buying a drink'. It's freaking great.

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Hawaii is Objectively Great | July 3, 2017 </h3>

In Hawaii now! Hawaii is __dope__ not because it's hawaii in a boasting sort of way but fundamentally because the place itself is objectively _great_ It's *incredibly* safe to walk around in which is a huge factor for me, and for a tropical island, is not ~that~ expensive if you keep an eye out for cheaper eateries. Plus, since it's a part of the United States, you get the familiar perks of the U.S. (eg IHOP (lol), USPS, familiar chains, etc.,) 

On top of that, there's tons of hiking, astronomy, nature, etc.,. I've been to a number of beachy-tropical areas (Jamaica, Los Angeles, etc.,) and this one surely tops the list. Definitely coming back =) 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Productivity | July 4, 2017 </h3>

"There is noting more exhausting than the task you've never started."

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> The Northeast is Objectively the Best Place to Live | July 2, 2017 </h3>

I can't help but feel the Northeast is a /fantastic/ place to live, largely because of its proximity to action-packed cities -- namely New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington D.C., and Baltimore. 

The fact that ~any~ of these locations are accessible by a cheap $20 bus amazes me. It would be such a huge thing I'd miss out on if I were to move away in the long-term. 

But then I think about the weather; cold weather __does__ suck, after all. But you can also look at it as a matter of appreciation -- because you can't truly appreciate the great feeling of walking into a warm, cozy house or shop until you've been shivering outside.

. . . but then again, that lasts about a week before it gets old. 

But even with that in mind, I think the power of having such major cities at your disposal is pretty much irreplaceable -- at least for me. 


<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Why Have a Daily Musings Page? | July 1, 2017 </h3>

In any case, that's part of the theoretical backbone of the 'daily musings' page. The goal, here, is to write in free blog form more frequently. The theoretical backbone of daily musings is: 

#### I. To produce more with perceived less
Human nature underestimates what can be done in small increments over a long period of time and overestimates what can be done as a large chunk in a short period of time. A person authoring a book, for example, would likely get way more done writing an hour a day for a year than cramming in a weekend -- assuming, of course, that she sticks to that schedule. 

It's cool to think that in 30 days, I'll have 30 awesome thought nuggets up here, especially given that a 5-minute post doesn't seem all that bad to do everyday =)

#### II. To set the bar low in terms of size
By defining the *Daily Musings* page as short 'thought nuggets' I set the bar low in terms of size. This prevents me from procrastinating writing, becuase writing a tidbit seems far more manageable than an entire post. 

It's way easier for me to meet an expectation of a <500 word thought nugget versus a full on 1000+ word post. That comes with less cognitive resistance to posting (i.e. less procrastinating).
