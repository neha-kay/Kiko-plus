<h1 style="color:#44C0FE;">30 Days of Daily Musings</h1>

### Why Have a Daily Musings Page? | July 1, 2017

In any case, that's part of the theoretical backbone of the 'daily musings' page. The goal, here, is to write in free blog form more frequently. The theoretical backbone of daily musings is: 

#### I. To produce more with perceived less
Human nature underestimates what can be done in small increments over a long period of time and overestimates what can be done as a large chunk in a short period of time. A person authoring a book, for example, would likely get way more done writing an hour a day for a year than cramming in a weekend -- assuming, of course, that she sticks to that schedule. 

It's cool to think that in 30 days, I'll have 30 awesome thought nuggets up here, especially given that a 5-minute post doesn't seem all that bad to do everyday =)

#### II. To set the bar low in terms of size
By defining the *Daily Musings* page as short 'thought nuggets' I set the bar low in terms of size. This prevents me from procrastinating writing, becuase writing a tidbit seems far more manageable than an entire post. 

It's way easier for me to meet an expectation of a <500 word thought nugget versus a full on 1000+ word post. That comes with less cognitive resistance to posting (i.e. less procrastinating).
