This is a part of **Couchsurfing 101: A Guide on Couchsurfing and How to Couchsurf**. If you haven’t already, I’d highly recommend starting at the beginning, [here](2017-07-01-couchsurfing-guide){:target="_blank"}.

## What do hosts want when deciding to host you?

1. A quality request
2. A detailed profile
3. A large number of positive references

There are other factors (gender, age, compatibility), but for the most part, if you can optimize the two factors above, you can get hosted regardless of the other minor factors.

Note that all Couchsurfing hosts aren't the same; a lot of 'old-school' surfers are fine with a one-line request while others don't care about the degree to which you've filled out your profile. For the most part though the rules above apply. 

### Part A: Request Personalization 

When writing a request, it's incredibly important to personalize it as much as possible. 

A lesson in life, not just Couchsurfing: success goes to the one who goes one step further than the rest.

Of course, most things in life aren’t necessarily zero-sum games (as the rule above implies), but in the case of Couchsurfing, often, it is. As a host who receives 5+ requests a day, I typically choose the one with the best request (and enough positive references). This usually involves declining the other 4.

This is what necessitates a stellar request: being the 1 and not the other 4.

### Part B: Number of Positive References

For obvious safety and practical reasons, most hosts will host you only if you have enough positive references. The more positive references you have, the more likely you are to get hosted. But no worries – as you surf, you’ll rack these up in no time.

Because you are new, your lack of references will invariably be more of a liability than an asset, so it’s crucial to make sure your profile and quality of request are high, to compensate for the lack of references.

But don’t worry; as you use surf more and more, this starts to work in your favor: once you have 10+ references you can usually get away with sending a more basic request, because your number of positive references compensate for the more basic request. Of course, there are hosts who are more lenient about positive references than others. Usually, these are the ones who’ll jump-start your reference list at the very beginning.

### How Do I Get Started?

#### Have 3-5 friends write you a 'personal reference'

There are 3 types of references -- from surfers, from hosts, and from personal friends. It looks better to have 3-5 personal references than trying to surf with 0. 

Make sure your friends are able to write a really strong review of you and aren’t afraid to go all out. This is an essential step. It’s nearly impossible to be hosted with 0 reviews, particularly if you’re male or headed to a popular city.

These were my first references from friends when I first started:

#### Upload at least 5 photos, including a photo of your face

Photos are INCREDIBLY important, so make sure you get them right. There are a number of studies I could cite that explicate the reasoning and science behind what I’m about to point out. If you’re interested in them, comment below and I’ll provide the links. But otherwise trust that you should:

- SMILE.
- Display yourself as someone people would glean value being around
- Make sure you have at least 1 photo showing your face clearly
- Try not to upload questionable photos . . . 

#### Pay it Forward Before Cashing In 

If you have a month or a few weeks before your travel takes off, host people before you travel.

This will ensure you have some Couchsurfing-associated references and will make it far easier for you to get hosted. You get a chance to see what Couchsurfing is all about from the easier position of being a host. There’s surely a chance that you won’t get requests, but it’s worth a try. Only accept people with a certain number of references (which you can decide for yourself. I usually only host people with 3-8 previous references, depending on their gender, age, and profile).

#### Surf the Small Waves Before Hitting the Big Ones

Surf in a less tourist-y city before hitting the big names. The logic behind this is simple: hosts in big cities are inundated with requests. By pure probability, you are less likely to get selected. Hosts in more low key cities usually don’t get many requests, and as a result, you’re far more likely to get hosted. Doing this 1-2 times, combined with requests from 2-3 of your friends would effectively put you in a perfect host-getting situation.

#### Go Solo on the First Trip
A number of hosts prefer hosting individuals over couples (including me :P). For your first few trips try and travel solo to increase your chances of getting hosted.

#### Fill out your profile completely and have an all star request.

The next sections talk about how to do so. Continue to the next page of the guide here.
