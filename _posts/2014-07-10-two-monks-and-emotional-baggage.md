This is a re-telling of an old Buddhist allegory:

### Crossing the River

> > "Long ago in Japan, two monks, one older and one younger, were walking down the road when they came to the edge of a river. A recent storm had washed away the bridge, and a young woman was standing by the side of the river. The current was rather strong, and she was unable to cross. 
> > 
> > The older of the two monks stopped and offered to carry the woman across. The woman gladly accepted and the monk did so. 
> > 
> > The younger monk watched in silence, aghast. He knew that it was against the rules of their order to have any physical contact with women. As the monks continued on with their journey, the younger monk stewed in the memory of his elder breaking one of the rules of the order. 
> > 
> > Finally, he could stand it no longer. "How could you?!?" the younger monk cried out. 
> > 
> > Startled, the older monk replied, "How could I? How could I what?"
"How could you carry that woman across the river when the rules of our order tell us otherwise?" said the younger monk. 
> > 
> > "Ah" said the older monk gently, "I left that woman back on the other side of the river. I see you are still carrying her.""
