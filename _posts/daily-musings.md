<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Invisible Racial Divisions in Italy üò≥| August 1, 2017 </h3>

Interestingly, people of color seem to occupy lower waged occupations here in Italy. Rather interestingly, I've seen a fair number of South Indians busking the streets and in other lower waged occupations. This is very much unlike the U.S., in which South Asians and Asians at large occupy the 'model minority' role. 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> A City That's Actually Polite to Its Pedestrians | August 2, 2017 </h3>

Traffic wise, Milan is the politest city I've been to. People *actually* stop for pedestrians. 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Attentiveness | August 1, 2017 </h3>

Today is my first day in Milan, Italy. 

My host took me on a tour of Milan, working our way from the outside in. He had a way of pointing out details I'd never normally notice -- art on columns, the architecture of the city, even pointing out the handle of a store and the way it was designed. I'm so unattuned to art.

I think the overall change in how I explored with him versus how I explore by myself is a matter of *attentiveness* - going slow and embracing all the details not just the most ostentatious ones.

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Forgive and Forget | July 31, 2017 </h3>

It is *so* important to have someone who doesn't hold grudges / can turn a new leaf, can forgive and forget easily in close relationships. Because over the course of 10+ years, each will mess up, a lot, and the last thing one wants is to feel crappy each time one messes up. There's something really humbling and great about forgiving people who don't hold something over your head, even when they're entitled to. 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Automating Good Decisions | July 30, 2017 </h3>

> > "Build a life that requires fewer decisions by surrounding themselves with people who embody the traits they prefer. Over time, they'll naturally pick up those desirable attitudes and behaviors. At the same time, they can avoid the mentally taxing low-level decisions that sap the energy needed for higher-stakes decisions."

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Long Term vs. Short Term Relationship View | July 29, 2017 </h3>

> > "You can treat your boss and co-workers as merely temporary colleagues, or you can deliberately treat them in a way that leads them to become lifelong fans of your career success.
> > 
> > I have old bosses and former co-workers from 15 years ago that would give me a job or recommend me for a job if I ever needed one.
> > 
> > There are people in my professional network that I‚Äôve been helping and who‚Äôve been helping me for over a decade.

> > This kind of thinking applies to more people than realize it." [Source](http://www.caseinterview.com/learning-from-mentors){:target="_blank"}

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;">  Thoughts on Time Wasters | July 25, 2017 </h3>

Some interesting tidbits from [an article I read](https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-start-a-company-with-no-free-time-b70fbe7b918a){:target="_blank"} by Sara Mauskopf: 

" <h3> Prepare your tasks </h3>
I spent time every week figuring out what I needed to accomplish and breaking that work into smaller, bite sized chunks. I had tiny projects that could be completed in a free 15 minutes, larger projects that would require a few hours, and all kinds of stuff in between. This was all waiting for me in priority order.

This way, if I had a few minutes to kill while my husband was waiting for an appointment or a couple hours while my daughter was napping, I didn‚Äôt need to waste any of that precious time figuring out what to work on. I got right to work on one of the tasks I had already prepared. This requires upfront planning but doesn‚Äôt take very long and it means you only do the planning work once and you have tasks for the whole week. Use Asana or Google Doc for this!"

<h3> Ask for actionable help </h3>

People are really bad at being helpful. Even when people ask to help you, they usually don‚Äôt follow through with it or do it in a way that is actually helpful. A lot of people would ask me how they could help me with Winnie and I‚Äôd say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love your feedback on the app!‚Äù and I‚Äôd hear back‚Ä¶ nothing.

It turns out ‚Äúgive me feedback‚Äù isn‚Äôt actionable enough for most people. Now when someone asks me how they can help I will give them something very specific to do: ‚ÄúDownload Winnie at winnie.com/ios and write a review of your favorite playground‚Äù.

When someone completes this task then they naturally also have feedback for me on what worked well or what could be better about the product.

<h3> Force yourself to do things imperfectly </h3>

To give a very practical example, I have given myself an hour to write this post before I‚Äôm on childcare duty. I can publish the post after that hour or I can spend more time later polishing it and making it perfect. I‚Äôm forcing myself to publish the piece before the hour is up even though it probably has some typos and maybe could be written more concisely.

The extra couple hours I could spend polishing it won‚Äôt make a massive difference in the number of people who read and benefit from this post. Perfectionism is a tough habit to break so you have to set time limits and force yourself to just put things out there even if they aren‚Äôt 100% perfect."

Throwback to when my high school [got in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/26/nyregion/reforms-to-ease-students-stress-divide-a-new-jersey-school-district.html?mcubz=2){:target="_blank"} for being too competitive =(.

It remains the case that the healthiest option I find the most tasty is indeed some sort of grilled Chipotle bowl or

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> One Coin Loophole | July 15, 2017 </h3>

In her podcast, Gretchen tells a story about coins: 
	¬†
> > Say you have 10 coins. Are you rich? Well, no. What if you add 1 coin? Okay, still no. What if you add another coin? You keep adding 1 coin by 1 coin. Finally, you have to say that you can't be rich unless you keep adding 1 coin. One coin by one coin, a person becomes rich and only by the addition of that one coin does she get the growing heap.
	¬†
This is the *One Coin Loophole*. 

The 1 coin loophole is saying on a given day, ‚Äòwell, what does it matter if I skip 1 coin? Doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôll skip it. Which is *true*, but the irony is that, it‚Äôs only 1 coin by 1 coin, small incremental, seemingly non-important action, that gets the desired growing heap. Aka, it's only one trip to the gym by one trip to the gym that you get the benefits and riches that come from going to the gym.

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> On Communication | July 13, 2017 </h3>

> > "Every act of communication is an act of tremendous courage in which we give ourselves over to two parallel possibilities: the possibility of planting into another mind a seed sprouted in ours and watching it blossom into a breathtaking flower of mutual understanding; and the possibility of being wholly misunderstood, reduced to a withering weed." 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Blog Dreams | July 12, 2017 </h3>

As some of my older friends know, I have wanted a blog for many, many, many years. Not just a simple, static site with basic contact info --- an actual site that can function as a public-facing root directory of my ideas and useful insights. 

In any case, I've wanted an uber cool blog for about 6 years now and I've started 3 that have totally failed. 3 blogs later, I think this is the one ‚ù§Ô∏è.

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Hawaii is Objectively Great | July 11, 2017 </h3>

In Hawaii now! Hawaii is __dope__ not because it's hawaii in a boasting sort of way but fundamentally because the place itself is objectively _great_ It's *incredibly* safe to walk around in which is a huge factor for me, and for a tropical island, is not ~that~ expensive if you keep an eye out for cheaper eateries. Plus, since it's a part of the United States, you get the familiar perks of the U.S. (eg IHOP (lol), USPS, familiar chains, etc.,) 

On top of that, there's tons of hiking, astronomy, nature, etc.,. I've been to a number of beachy-tropical areas (Jamaica, Los Angeles, etc.,) and this one surely tops the list. Definitely coming back =) 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Overcoming Relationship Inertia | July 10, 2017 </h3>

I have a friendship which maybe isn't going the best way at the moment and part of me just wants to get super real and try and talk stuff out -- to hit some sort of 'reset' button back to the good 'ol times. But then, I have to realize that we don't live in a frictionless world, that indeed that friction is a very real force which makes a reset button virtually non-existent. 

For example, you can *try* and say to someone, "hey -- let's just reset, do X, and not do Y" and maybe that works on a superficial level, but underneath, there are just too many unresolved feelings, and a bit of awkward tension that comes with that -- the friction which makes it an unfeasible solution.

The better way, I think, is to just continually be a great person, until slowly they respond in kind. 

I think people notice and respond to the *integration of behavior* -- in other words, actions and behavior repeated over and over again. 

It's a slower solution but a more tractable one, I think.

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Overcoming Relationship Inertia | July 11, 2017 </h3>

Today, a close friend of mine asked me for relationship advice and I felt *super* honored. Like, super, super honored =). 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> A useful heuristic for making decisions | July 9, 2017 </h3>

Asking:
1) What‚Äôs the worst that can happen?
2) What‚Äôs the best that can happen?

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Disqus + Google Analytics | July 8, 2017 </h3>

Disqus & Google Analytics are officially working! It‚Äôs amazing how small achievements seem after you‚Äôve done them and how big tasks seem before you‚Äôve achieved them. 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Dental Hygiene on Point | July 7, 2017 </h3>

My dental hygiene has been SO on point recently. I haven't *not* flossed since 
<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Interview with first female billionaire + Spanx fouder, Sara Blakely | July 6, 2017 </h3>

Today I listened to a podcast which undoubtedly is on my all time favorite podcast episodes list -- [an interview with the Spanx founder, Sara Blakely](http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=493169696:493311384){:target="_blank"}. It's definitely an experiential listen than a pure knowledge-based one so I'd highly recommend just downloading and getting into it. But below are a couple of the things that really resonated with me. 

##### The notion that ideas are most vulnerable in their infancy

 > > "I kept it [the idea of Spanx] a secret for 1 year. I was very careful right away to keep it to myself because I believe ideas are most vulnerable in their infancy. It's instinct to turn to your right or left and tell a friend and when you do that, ego is invited into the mix and then you spend all your time defending the idea and explaining it and not pursuing it. I needed to be at the place where I knew I wouldn't turn back no matter what I heard. I had invested enough of my time and sweat equity into the idea that I told people and the things I heard were "if it's such a good idea why hasn't someone done it already?" and "if it's a good idea then you're gonna spend your savings on this and in 6 months, the big guys are gonna knock you out of the water." And these things were all coming from a place of love but I feel like if I heard all of that at the beginning, I'd probably still be selling fax machines." 

##### Her sheer resolve and willingness to break the rules to get Spanx out there
> > [Interviewer] "When you got into Neiman Marcus - were you like, I made it?""
> > [Blakely] "Absolutely not - that is the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make -- that's when the work begins! I paid friends to go out and buy the product and create a buzz about it.
I called all the friends I had - called friends I hadn't spoken to since 4th grade saying, "hey this is Lisa, I  know we haven't spoken since 4th grade but do you mind going to the store and buying Spanx and I'll send you a check?"...I stood in the stores from 9-5 or 6 every day and went to Target and bought stands which I put up at at the checkout area in Neiman Marcus -- they all thought it was approved from higher ups so they all left the stands there." 


<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> I'll Buy You a Beer | July 5, 2017 </h3>

I really love the concept of buying someone a beer. It's way cheaper than buying them a meal, makes me feel like sexism isn't a thing, and has a friendly undertone, compared to 'buying a drink'. It's freaking great.

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Hawaii is Objectively Great | July 4, 2017 </h3>

In Hawaii now! Hawaii is __dope__ not because it's hawaii in a boasting sort of way but fundamentally because the place itself is objectively _great_ It's *incredibly* safe to walk around in which is a huge factor for me, and for a tropical island, is not ~that~ expensive if you keep an eye out for cheaper eateries. Plus, since it's a part of the United States, you get the familiar perks of the U.S. (eg IHOP (lol), USPS, familiar chains, etc.,) 

On top of that, there's tons of hiking, astronomy, nature, etc.,. I've been to a number of beachy-tropical areas (Jamaica, Los Angeles, etc.,) and this one surely tops the list. Definitely coming back =) 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Productivity | July 3, 2017 </h3>

"There is noting more exhausting than the task you've never started."

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> The Northeast is Objectively the Best Place to Live | July 2, 2017 </h3>

I can't help but feel the Northeast is a /fantastic/ place to live, largely because of its proximity to action-packed cities -- namely New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington D.C., and Baltimore. 

The fact that ~any~ of these locations are accessible by a cheap $20 bus amazes me. It would be such a huge thing I'd miss out on if I were to move away in the long-term. 

But then I think about the weather; cold weather __does__ suck, after all. But you can also look at it as a matter of appreciation -- because you can't truly appreciate the great feeling of walking into a warm, cozy house or shop until you've been shivering outside.

. . . but then again, that lasts about a week before it gets old. 

But even with that in mind, I think the power of having such major cities at your disposal is pretty much irreplaceable -- at least for me. 

<h3 style="color:#6495ed;"> Why Have a Daily Musings Page? | July 1, 2017 </h3>

Daily Musings is meant to be an outlet for short thought snippets -- no more, no less. 
Why have one? Well, the goal, here is to write in free blog form more frequently. The theoretical backbone of daily musings is the following: 

##### I. To produce more with perceived less
Human nature underestimates what can be done in small increments over a long period of time and overestimates what can be done as a large chunk in a short period of time. A person authoring a book, for example, would likely get way more done writing an hour a day for a year than cramming in a weekend -- assuming, of course, that she sticks to that schedule. 

It's cool to think that in 30 days, I'll have 30 awesome thought nuggets up here, especially given that a 5-minute post doesn't seem all that bad to do everyday =)

##### II. To set the bar low in terms of size
By defining the *Daily Musings* page as short 'thought nuggets' I set the bar low in terms of size. This prevents me from procrastinating writing, becuase writing a tidbit seems far more manageable than an entire post. 

It's way easier for me to meet an expectation of a <500 word thought nugget versus a full on 1000+ word post. That comes with less cognitive resistance to posting (i.e. less procrastinating). 

Eventually, I'll take the date tags off and it'll just be 'Daily Musings'. But for now, I totally need the extra accountability to continually re-visit and re-post.
