* Italy
* Thailand
* Argentina
* Brazil

### Favorite Experiences (in no particular order)

* Myanmar (Burma) - The most epic people, super, super cheap, stunned by [Shwedagon Pagoda](https://www.google.it/search?q=shwedagon+pagoda&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixst_p5d7VAhXD0RQKHStSAqkQ_AUICigB&biw=1226&bih=780){:target="_blank"}
* Ghana - Worked with and met some of the greatest people ever.
* United Kingdom - Studied as a visiting student at Oxford, what's not to love?

### Countries I Want to Go Back To. . . (in no particular order)

* Argentina and Chile - So much to see + absolutely beautiful, need to visit Patagonia
* Brazil - *incredibly* fun country (especially Rio ðŸ˜›)

### Great but Wouldn't Recommend Locations 

* South Korea - I found it a bit boring ðŸ˜• (but that's just me!!)
* Jamaica - Expensive and pretty creepy -- as a thrifty female, both of these are dealbreakers ðŸ˜•
* Ecuador - Besides _Mitad del Mundo_ found it a bit boring (but that's just me!!) 
* Switzerland - Expensive *AF*

### Footsteps Abroad

This was taken somewhere on the [autobahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn){:target="_blank"} --- German highways with no federally mandated speed limit. ðŸ˜‰

In 2015, I visited Dublin, Ireland on _St. Patrick's Day_. Yep, and it was as insane as that sounded and more. If you could imagine an entire city erupting in a party for 3 consecutive nights, that's more or less what St. Patrick's Day is like in Ireland's capital city. These were some of the crowds during the festival.

Kayaking in caves in Phang Nga Bay, Thailand! This also happens to be where the James Bond movie, _The Man with the Golden Gun_ was filmed.

This was New Year's in Burma! As explained [here](http://www.123newyear.com/newyear-traditions/buddhist.html){:target="_blank"}:

> "According to Buddhist traditions, no celebrations or festivals are considered to be complete until and unless one lights up candles in the temples and monasteries, as doing so is considered to be a symbol of showing love and respect to the blessed souls and to the supreme power. Also, it is considered to bless petitioner with good luck and happiness for the coming time. The same goes for New Year celebrations as well. On New Year day, people in Buddhist countries make a visit to temples and monasteries, bath Buddha statues, offer prayers and worship to Lord Buddha, and call for getting conferred with happy and peaceful times ahead."
