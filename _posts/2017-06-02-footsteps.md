### Favorite Experiences (in no particular order)

* Myanmar (Burma) - The most epic people, super, super cheap, stunned by [Shwedagon Pagoda](https://www.google.it/search?q=shwedagon+pagoda&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixst_p5d7VAhXD0RQKHStSAqkQ_AUICigB&biw=1226&bih=780){:target="_blank"}
* Ghana - Worked with and met some of the greatest people ever.

### Countries I Want to Go Back To. . . (in no particular order)

* Argentina and Chile - So much to see + absolutely beautiful, need to visit Patagonia
* Brazil - *incredibly* fun country (especially Rio ðŸ˜›)

### Great but Wouldn't Recommend Locations 

* South Korea - I found it a bit boring ðŸ˜• (but that's just me!!)
* Jamaica - Expensive and pretty creepy -- as a thrifty female, both of these are dealbreakers ðŸ˜•
* Ecuador - Besides _Mitad del Mundo_ found it a bit boring (but that's just me!!) 
* Switzerland - Expensive *AF*
