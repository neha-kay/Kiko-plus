* Italy
* Thailand
* Argentina
* Brazil

### Favorite Experiences (in no particular order)

* Myanmar (Burma) - The most epic people, super, super cheap, stunned by the [Shwedagon Pagoda](https://www.google.it/search?q=shwedagon+pagoda&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixst_p5d7VAhXD0RQKHStSAqkQ_AUICigB&biw=1226&bih=780){:target="_blank"}.
* Ghana - Worked with and met some of the greatest people ever.
* United Kingdom - Studied as a visiting student at Oxford, what's not to love?

### Countries I Want to Go Back To. . . (in no particular order)

* Argentina and Chile - So much to see + absolutely beautiful, need to visit Patagonia.
* Brazil - *incredibly* fun country (especially Rio ðŸ˜› ).

### Great but Wouldn't Recommend Locations 

* South Korea - I found it a bit boring ðŸ˜• (but that's just me)
* Jamaica - Expensive and pretty creepy -- as a thrifty female, both of these are dealbreakers ðŸ˜•
* Ecuador - Besides _Mitad del Mundo_ found it a bit boring (but that's just me) 
* Switzerland - Expensive *AF*

### Footsteps Abroad

This photo above was taken somewhere on the [autobahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn){:target="_blank"} --- German highways with no federally mandated speed limit. ðŸ˜‰

In 2015, I visited Dublin, Ireland on St. Patrick's Day. Yep, and it was as insane as that sounded, and more. 

If you could imagine an entire city erupting in a party for 3 consecutive nights, that's more or less what St. Patrick's Day is like in Ireland's capital city. These were some of the crowds during the festival.

Me in the Gangnam district in South Korea! Yes, I did the Gangnam Style dance there, and no, I will not be posting that. ðŸ˜›

Kayaking in caves in Phang Nga Bay, in Thailand. 

This also happens to be where the James Bond movie, _The Man with the Golden Gun_ was filmed.

  <img src="/images/photos-travel/8-paris.jpg">
</p>

This photo above of the [Arc de Triomphe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe){:target="_blank"} is by far, one of my favorite photos. I had taken a bus (from Brussels, I think?) to Paris, but of course, it arrived _ridiculously_ early in the morning --- around 6 am or so. And so I sort of shurgged, and figured I'd visit the Eiffel Tower, because, well, why not. On the way, I passed by this beauty, caught right as the sun was rising.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/shwedagon.jpg">
</p>

This is the [Shwedagon Pagoda](https://www.google.gr/search?q=shwedagon+pagoda&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCuaLYxu_VAhWqD8AKHQ2mBacQ_AUICigB&biw=701&bih=736){:target="_blank"}, in Burma. Even after 28+ countries, the Shwedagon Pagoda is by far, the most impressive religious structure I've _ever_ seen --- far more impressive than even [St. Peter's Basilica](https://www.google.gr/search?biw=701&bih=696&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=st.+peter%27s+basilica&oq=st.+peter%27s+bas&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0j0i30k1l3.55474.57301.0.58136.15.12.0.0.0.0.241.1305.0j7j1.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..7.8.1304...0i67k1.NHKf5NUWoLM){:target="_blank"}. It's simply absolutely _stunning_.

</p>

This is [Wat Rong Khun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Rong_Khun){:target="_blank"} in Chang Rai, Thailand. The entire structure is symbolic of Buddhist philosophy. As explained by Wikipedia:

> > "The main building at the white temple, the ubosot, is reached by crossing a bridge, "the cycle of rebirth", over a small lake. In front of the bridge are hundreds of outreaching hands that symbolize unrestrained desire. The bridge proclaims that the way to happiness is by foregoing temptation, greed, and desire."

</p>

This was the 2016 New Year in Burma! As explained [here](http://www.123newyear.com/newyear-traditions/buddhist.html){:target="_blank"}:

> "According to Buddhist traditions, no celebrations or festivals are considered to be complete until and unless one lights up candles in the temples and monasteries, as doing so is considered to be a symbol of showing love and respect to the blessed souls and to the supreme power. Also, it is considered to bless petitioner with good luck and happiness for the coming time. The same goes for New Year celebrations as well. On New Year day, people in Buddhist countries make a visit to temples and monasteries, bath Buddha statues, offer prayers and worship to Lord Buddha, and call for getting conferred with happy and peaceful times ahead."

Visiting [Machu Picchu](){:target="_blank"} of the Incan civilization.

</p>

This is [Shibuya crossing](https://www.google.gr/search?q=Shibuya+crossing&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQ1rPMy-_VAhVpLcAKHWWrA3gQsAQIOQ&biw=700&bih=736){:target="_blank"}, in Tokyo, famed to be the busiest intersection in the world. Find me!

My Tokyo host above was _amazing_. He not only let me stay at his place for almost a week but also cooked me an _amazing_ traditional Japanese dinner.

This is me and Nicole being crazy, and totally contradicting the prim and proper British ways. ðŸ˜›

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/11-czech.jpg">
</p>

In the Czech Republic, it was so interesting to see kids casually walking the streets alone --- such a different cultural take than the American view of 'kids walking alone is incredibly dangerous'.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/13-scotland-volcano.jpg">
</p>

This was a mountain I climbed in Scotland which would have been an awesome hike, had it not started snowing and hailing _super_ hard halfway up. Suffice to say, I still made it up and back down without dying. 

Below is an image of the mountain from afar.

</p>

This was _the best_ pastry shop I've ever been to, in Madrid, Spain. Cakes and pastries to die for.

I believe it was [La Mallorquina](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2071743-Reviews-La_Mallorquina-Madrid.html){:target="_blank"} that we went to, but I guess I'll have to re-visit to be 100% sure. ðŸ˜›
