# Introduction

Before starting I want to first point out that I am just another human – by no means the most productive nor an expert on the topic by any means. These are simply my ideas on productivity and what has worked for me in getting out of unproductive ruts. I hope you glean some useful tidbit from it. If you have useful (or better?) tips, leave them in the comments below. With that, onwards, new friend!

Specifically, this guide is meant to provide insight into the following questions:
TO-DO list questions

# Tangent: the problem with waiting for productivity or motivation.

Is it possible to build self-discipline or motivation? I have no idea. What I **do** know is that developing self-discipline, self-control, or perseverance is hard. After 10+ years of desperately wanting to, I couldn’t tell you what that involves. Behavior change is hard. Really, really hard. So my solution, which for me has worked way better, is to sort of:

1. Accept my lazy self and not berate myself on having less self-control / determination to do X, Y, or Z project. In other words, this involves not hoping or waiting or aiming for a moment of greater motivation or energy to do my side projects
2. Instead, __influence my environment__ through hacks like self-imposed accountability to make it more conducive to get what I want done given my level of lower motivation or self-discipline. 

# Deconstructing Unproductivity

I think we can all admit our most productive intervals happen in the context of either work or school. Analyzing why this is the case can provide further insight into creating this kind of environment for personal projects. 

## Why do we tend to get an enormous amount of work done at work and school despite having little internal motivation to do so? 

I’d argue it’s for 3 chief reasons:

### 1. Clarity in what needs to be done

When we’re not sure what needs to be done on a school assignment or problem set, we ask the professor or the TA until we have a clear sense of what needs to be done. In a work context, we’d ask our bosses or colleagues what a deliverable entails if there’s any amount of confusion. This clarity then allows us to better deconstruct a goal or deliverable into more actionable tasks that we then proceed to work on. 

### 2. Clarity in when a deliverable is due

If our boss or professor hasn’t provided a deadline for a deliverable, it tends to get put on the backburner in favor of other action items.

More on this later, but suffice to say, having a clear notion of when something is due increases the likelihood it will be completed soon. Indeed deadlines can be incredibly motivating. 

### 3. The presence and awareness of consequences if an action item isn’t done

In the context of school, these consequences of non-action present themselves as really bad grades (a consequence of not studying). In the context of work, these consequences present themselves as a lack of respect from co-workers, a lower work evaluation, letting others down, etc., In both cases, the consequences are both A) understood beforehand and B) pretty severe. 

### So what causes unproductivity?
The inverse of the distillation above defines unproductivity. Specifically, I’d argue unproductivity derives from the following 4 elements:

#### I. A lack of clarity of what needs to be done (see Goal Organization guide) 
#### II. A lack of clarity of the time one has or the time required for a set of tasks (see Time Organization guide)
#### III. A lack of accountability -- aka a deadline and a set of consequences if a deliverable isn’t done on time

I address the first two points in the Goal Organization and Time Organization guides respectively so check out those guides if those are areas you also struggle in. 

In this piece I’ll address the third point and present a solution, accountability sprints, as a vehicle for counteracting unproductivity. 

# Accountability as a solution against unproductivity

Accountability is the __invisible magical force that gets us to be productive in school and work despite lackluster motivation__. Sure, we end up working right up till the deadline and the night before, but <i><strong>we get it done</i></strong>. As mentioned above, accountability involves: 

#### * A strict deadline 
#### * A set of consequences if a deliverable isn’t completed on time

### Our home environment and side projects lack accountability 

By nature, our home environments and personal projects are free of accountability. 

But that also means your personal projects will fall by the wayside when in competition with work or school deadlines. Why? Because the latter has strict consequences for incompletion so naturally, we’ll prioritize these deadlines over our personal projects with rather moveable deadlines. 

### How do I practically use accountability to get more work done?

Specifically, you need: 

#### * Explicitly written tangible deliverables
#### * Explicitly written deadlines
#### * A friend who’s willing to hold you accountable to a given set of deliverables at a certain date
#### * Strict, pre-agreed upon consequences if deliverables are not done by a given time or by a certain standard

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Have a concrete sense of the deliverables you’d like to get done. Below is a good example of a set of concrete deliverables: 

If you find yourself having trouble concret-izing your goals into actionable to-do items, I’d recommend you check out my Goal Organization guide.

#### Step 2: Message a friend and see if they’re willing to hold you accountable to a set of deliverables 

#### Step 3. Assuming your friend is willing to hold you accountable, formally send them a write up of a set of tasks to complete, a deadline, and consequences if things aren’t completed properly or on time. 

Let’s see this in action with the following examples below.

A caveat: as you noticed, accountability sprints guarantee a deliverable getting done, but not necessarily getting done well. Sometimes you can quantify what it means for a deliverable to be done well -- for example, specifying "4 bar charts", but often it's hard to perfectly quantify quality. This is definitely a weakness of accountability sprints largely because it's largely dependent on internal motivation. I generally go back and edit my deliverables after, to make them more presentable.
