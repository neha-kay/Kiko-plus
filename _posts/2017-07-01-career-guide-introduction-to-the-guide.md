Welcome to the Career Guide! 

For years we grapple with the question, “What do you want to do?” 
For graduating college seniors, it’s an especially unsettling question; the time we have to procrastinate the decision is very obviously (and unnervingly) winding down.

This was very much the case with me. While I had a general sense of my career objectives, I considered myself nothing short of naïve. What should I prioritize – money, titles, personal growth, prestige? Is their validity to the ‘passion hypothesis’? What should I be doing to maximize the career opportunities available to me? 

My natural instinct was to consult the experts – researching advice from experts on developing one’s career. Over the past few months, I’ve read their advice and created this guide, in an effort to help fellow graduating seniors around me and, more generally, spread knowledge on a rather fuzzy topic.

In writing this guide, I’ve done my best to cull the cream of advice from the books I’ve read, elaborating on the most thought-provoking advice along with themes which consistently emerge across different authors. I’ll also note areas in which authors come to a disagreement, though in my experience this happens far less than the former. Specifically, this guide relies on advice from the following best-selling books: 

Defining Decade
Startup of You
The Art of Work
So Good They Can’t Ignore You
Never Eat Alone
Lean In

Please note that I’m not a career expert in any way; I’m simply defaulting to the experience and advice highlighted by these pieces. I’ve done my best to provide references throughout the guide to the books which support a given idea; if the idea peaks your interest, you’re free to delve into the details via the book itself. 

This guide won’t tell you which career to pursue or answer any million dollar question. Rather, I hope it will provide insight to the following questions, based on the insight from experts who have years of wisdom on the topic:

-	Out of college, what should I focus on – money, personal growth, titles, or prestige? 
-	Some people have 5 year & 10 year plans while others refuse to plan at all. Should I be planning my career trajectory out?  
-	What can I do to increase the career opportunities available to me?
-	Sure I know people… but how can I use that to get a job?
-	Everyone talks about building networks but no one talks about maintaining the network I do have. How do I go about this?
-	I keep sending applications out, but never hear back. Why isn’t this working and what can I do to fix it?
-	How do I build a better brand for myself?
-	Everyone says 'do what you love' but it sounds a bit flaky. Should I be listening to that advice?
-	Successful people work hard but they also seem to have good luck. How do make luck?
-	How do I build a better brand for myself?
