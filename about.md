## About the Site

Hi! My name is Neha. This is my brain space - my tabula rasa for random thoughts.

In September 2015, I published [The Official Couchsurfing Guide](http://www.neha-kulkarni.com/couchsurfing-101-the-ultimate-couchsurfing-guide/) which became super popular within the Couchsurfing community.

Now, back to a modest 10-20 daily visitors, I focus on updating the blog with my thoughts on career exploration, organization, entrepreneurship, and positive psychology. The website is mostly a place for me to share my thoughts, in the event others like me will find them useful.

Welcome, have fun, and if you see something you like, reach out - either on the page itself, or to me directly at <neha@nehakay.com>.

## About Me

### My friends describe me as . . . 
* Cheerful
* Playful
* Bubbly
* Analytical
* High-energy
* Giving
* Spreadsheet-oriented (thanks Alex :P)

I used to joke that I have basically no social life, but I don't think that's entirely true anymore. My close friends and family mean the world to me. If we've ever videochatted, or hung out at a board game night, or in person, you know I'm referring to you. 

In general, I'm pretty binary when it comes to relationships; I know most people from a distance, with the exception of a select few whom I invest all my energy in. So I guess I'm pretty picky when it comes to close relationships and take a good deal of time to warm up to people. But if I do warm up, I can promise an incredibly intense and fulfilling relationship.

### I spend a lot of time thinking about . . .

__Personal Development__

I consider myself a constantly evolving piece of software - continually identifying the bugs and feature implementations I can add to myself and the million things I have yet to learn. Reid Hoffman terms this state of being ‚Äúpermanent beta‚Äù, which I *entirely* identify with.

Sometimes a feature gets added and the whole thing blows up (cue Stack Overflow), but for the most part, it‚Äôs worked out pretty well. I can't imagine not being obsessed about personal development, what I can learn, and how I can improve; it comes with its ups and downs but for the most part, I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come and more importantly, how much further I have to go from here.

__Optimizing / Engineering Life__

‚Ä¶as opposed to simply letting it happen.

__Future plans / future trajectory__

or in other words, how to maximize the impact and value I provide in my chosen career path.

### 10 things I could never do without . . . 

- eBooks, audiobooks, podcasts
- My Google Calendar <3
- Long, hot showers
- Non-fiction books
- Family and close friends
- Accountability frameworks
- Playfulness :P
- Highly logical / analytical people with a soft side
- My Macbook
- Chipotle or any source of cheap, healthy, vegetarian meals (Dipti Aunty, you know I'm talking about you too üòõ . . .)

### What I'm Doing With My Life

I studied at Johns Hopkins as a double major, double minor, majoring in Economics & Psychology and minoring in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship & Management. 

Like most people, I had generally no clue as to what I'd want to do in the future, beyond wanting to gain technical skill. I researched a ton and even documented my research as a career guide (INSERT LINK) before hitting the college fall recruiting season in full force. 

I was lucky enough to receive 8 job offers in the fall with companies probably far too good for me --  Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton, Prudential, Teach for America, Bloomberg, etc., before finally choosing to work at Microsoft in February 2018. 

If I can be of any help to you in terms of job recruiting / getting a job / the job search feel free to email me at <neha@nehakay.com>; I'm happy to help out and pay it forward üòä 

In any case, from a long-term perspective, I still have no clue what I want to do in the future. But I'm open-minded, driven, and ready to put in the time if I see or create something valuable.

### In my free time I . . . 

* Rant about Apple products 
* Rant about Chipotle
* Videochat with friends
* Spend embarrassing amounts of time on my computer (shout out to Reem for pointing this out)
* Travel

As of July 2017, I've [traveled to 26 countries](http://www.nehakay.com/2017-06-02/footsteps/){:target="_blank"} and will be traveling to the last few countries I want to see before settling down and starting work at Microsoft.
