## About the Site

Hi! My name is Neha. This is my brain space - my tabula rasa for random thoughts.

In September 2015, I published [The Official Couchsurfing Guide](http://www.neha-kulkarni.com/couchsurfing-101-the-ultimate-couchsurfing-guide/) which became super popular within the Couchsurfing community.

Now, back to a modest 10-20 daily visitors, I focus on updating the blog with my thoughts on career exploration, organization, entrepreneurship, and positive psychology. The website is mostly a place for me to share my thoughts, in the event others like me will find them useful.

Welcome, have fun, and if you see something you like, reach out - either on the page itself, or to me directly.

## About Me

I spend a lot of time thinking about ...

__Personal Development__

I consider myself a constantly evolving piece of software - continually identifying the bugs and feature implementations I can add to myself and the million things I have yet to learn. Reid Hoffman terms this state of being “permanent beta”, which I *entirely* identify with.

Sometimes a feature gets added and the whole thing blows up (cue Stack Overflow), but for the most part, it’s worked out pretty well. I can't imagine not being obsessed about personal development, what I can learn, and how I can improve; it comes with its ups and downs but for the most part, I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come and more importantly, how much further I have to go from here.

__Optimizing / Engineering Life__

…as opposed to simply letting it happen.

__Future plans / future trajectory__

or in other words, how to maximize the impact and value I provide in my chosen career path.
