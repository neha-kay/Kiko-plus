## About the Site

Hi! My name is Neha. This is my brain space - my tabula rasa for random thoughts.

In September 2015, I published [The Official Couchsurfing Guide](http://www.neha-kulkarni.com/couchsurfing-101-the-ultimate-couchsurfing-guide/) which became super popular within the Couchsurfing community.

Now, back to a modest 10-20 daily visitors, I focus on updating the blog with my thoughts on career exploration, organization, entrepreneurship, and positive psychology. The website is mostly a place for me to share my thoughts, in the event others like me will find them useful.

Welcome, have fun, and if you see something you like, reach out - either on the page itself, or to me directly at <neha@nehakay.com>.

## About Me

My friends have described me as:
* Cheerful
* Playful
* Bubbly
* Analytical
* High-energy
* Giving
* Spreadsheet oriented 

(All of the descriptions above have ~actually originated from people~, including, to no one's surprise, the spreadsheet one (thanks Alex.. :P))

I studied at Johns Hopkins as a double major, double minor, majoring in Economics & Psychology and minoring in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship & Management. 

The summer before senior year, I researched quite a bit on career prospects

### Questionable nerd status? 

I used to joke that I have basically no social life, but I don't think that's entirely true anymore. 

In general, I'm pretty binary when it comes to relationships; I know most people from a distance, with the exception of a select few whom I invest all my energy in. So I guess I'm pretty picky when it comes to close relationships and take a good deal of time to warm up to people. But if I do warm up, I can promise an incredibly intense and fulfilling relationship.

(Is it just me or is this starting to sound like Shaadi.com)

In any case, after college recruiting season and in the last semester of college, I took to really investing in the close friends I had -- through videochats, phone calls, and epic board game nights.

I'm in an odd place where my identity as a nerd is entirely compromised; nerds don't have vibrant social lives, do they? 

### In my free time I ... 

* Rant about Apple products 
* Rant about Chipotle
* Travel

As of July 2017, I've traveled to 26 countries and fufilling the last few countries I want to see before settling down and starting work at Microsoft.

### I spend a lot of time thinking about ...

__Personal Development__

I consider myself a constantly evolving piece of software - continually identifying the bugs and feature implementations I can add to myself and the million things I have yet to learn. Reid Hoffman terms this state of being “permanent beta”, which I *entirely* identify with.

Sometimes a feature gets added and the whole thing blows up (cue Stack Overflow), but for the most part, it’s worked out pretty well. I can't imagine not being obsessed about personal development, what I can learn, and how I can improve; it comes with its ups and downs but for the most part, I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come and more importantly, how much further I have to go from here.

__Optimizing / Engineering Life__

…as opposed to simply letting it happen.

__Future plans / future trajectory__

or in other words, how to maximize the impact and value I provide in my chosen career path.
